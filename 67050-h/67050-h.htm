</div>

<p>The background and details of this story have been
carefully authenticated. The founding of the colony
Inessa, however, is not an actual event. It is the union
of a number of colony traditions. It is therefore correct
in character and spirit.</p>

<p>The tale was written at the MacDowell Colony at
Peterborough, New Hampshire, and I am constantly
mindful of the inspiration given to me by the beautiful
and solitary surroundings in which I there worked.</p>

<span class="smaller">DRYAS WINS THE PRIZE</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Dryas</span>, the young Delphian, finished his song.
As he did so he leaped impulsively to the sheer
edge of the temple platform, leaning forward
in the very attitude of the Archer God. The song
was to Apollo. For a moment he seemed to be the
young Apollo himself.</p>

<p>The final note was scarce heard for the surge of applause
which met it. The people pelted the boy with
flowers—snatched off their own garlands to throw to
him—until he stood ankle deep in the bloom. He was
blushing, shy, now that his song was finished. Awestruck,
too, for he heard everywhere the shout:</p>

<p>“The Prize! The Prize!”</p>

<p>Thus ended the first day of the Pythian festival at
Delphi. The crowds poured down through the Precinct,
a very tumult of colour and motion. White-robed
priests, purple-cloaked kings, Sybarites in cloth
of gold, young athletes beautiful as the sunlight in which
they moved; and upon every man’s head, rich or poor,
his crown of flowers.</p>

<p>How freely they talked, how happily gave themselves
to laughter! The truce of God was upon them—that
peace which Apollo imposed upon the passionate, warring<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
Greeks at festival time. Delphi itself, forbidding
amid its beetling cliffs, seemed to lose sternness at this
festival. Out on the far-seen hillsides were the booths
and bright-coloured tents of the visitors, the flash and
glitter of things brought for sale. Even yet crowds of
pilgrims were arriving, swarming up the steep winding
roads as the bees were fabled of old to have swarmed
thither to build the first temple in Delphi.</p>

<p>Dryas, his father, Nikander, and his brother, Lycophron,
came down through the stirring Precinct, perhaps
the happiest hearts of all the multitude.</p>

<p>The prize at Delphi! It was an immortal honour.
The noblest poets of Greece would write hymns in his
praise. Dryas’s whole town would bask in the honour
of it. Dryas’s statue in bronze would be set up near
the Precinct gate, and in future years his sons and
sons’ sons would recount the victory.</p>

<p>Neighbours, kinsfolk, strangers, halted them on their
homeward way. No man in Hellas was too exalted to
pause in humility and delight to greet the young victor
with the crown yet fresh upon his head. But it was to
the father, Nikander, rather than to Dryas that they
addressed themselves, lingering to catch if it were but a
reflection of the surprised joy in that father-face.</p>

<p>Nikander walked holding his boy’s hand, or touching
his shoulder as he presented him to some famous man.</p>

<p>“You liked it?” he would say, his sensitive face flushing
almost as Dryas’s own. “You liked the song?
Yes, I, too, enjoyed it—that stern opening—the Dorian
mode. It was as new in my hearing as in yours. The
dear lad kept it so.”</p>

<p>And Dryas’s answering look showed the father’s
praise to be the most precious of all. It was no usual
affection which bound these two together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>And now Pindar, the greatest poet, met them, outstretching
both his hands.</p>

<p>“Nikander! Dryas! Kairos bless you both! You
are tasting the heady joy of victory!”</p>

<p>“Eating victory rather,” put in the elder brother,
Lycophron, with a rough laugh. “Feasting on it in
courses I should say.”</p>

<p>At his father’s hurt look he stopped and laid his hand
upon the father’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Tut,” he said, “I meant no harm.” Then he turned
to the poet: “Pindar, I hope you are coming to us to-night,
speaking of feasts; a symposium in Dryas’s
honour.”</p>

<p>Pindar frowned at the young man’s forwardness
but assented, then smiled again as he turned to
Dryas.</p>

<p>“It was almost as good as your father’s victor song
years ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, better, much better,” urged Nikander. At
which Pindar moved onward, laughing, shaking his
head. A lovable man, Pindar.</p>

<p>They arrived finally at their own door. All the
slaves were there bowing and curtseying, Medon, the
old pedagogue, at their head. He peered up eagerly
to see if the boy really wore the laurel crown and, at
sight of it, trembled visibly with joy.</p>

<p>“Little Dryas, little Dryas,” he crooned, all love.</p>

<p>Nikander must needs stop to rehearse all his happiness
to the old servant. And who so glad to hear as
Medon!</p>

<p>“All Dryas’s songs have been good,” Nikander finished.
“But, oh, this one to-day is in a new class! Do
you know what the rascal did, Medon? Brought out
an utterly new poem, different from any I ever heard.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
Imagine my amazement when he started out—and my
delight!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master, yes!” assented Medon.</p>

<p>As they talked, they had been moving slowly through
the andron and now entered the women’s court.</p>

<p>Melantho, the mother, hearing them enter, came
running down the stair to fold her son in her arms.
Baltè, the old nurse, hobbled up. Nerea, Clito, and
other slave girls came and kissed the hem of his robe.</p>

<p>But Nikander missed one member of the household.</p>

<p>“Where is Eleutheria?” he asked.</p>

<p>Then he caught sight of her standing in the far
corner of the court—his daughter, tall, delicately
flushed with that air between shyness and pride which
is common to all new-flowering things.</p>

<p>“Daughter,” said Nikander, “we have come home
with the crown!”</p>

<p>She bowed her dark head, fingering her distaff with its
tangled threads.</p>

<p>“Come, my dear,” said Nikander, snapping his fingers
to hasten her. “Come, greet your brother victor.”</p>

<p>Then she looked up—a face full of some strange
startling emotion.</p>

<p>“No,” she half whispered.</p>

<p>“No? What on earth do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I cannot,” she spoke sharply. “I cannot praise
him.”</p>

<p>“You are ill,” said Nikander, going to her. Indeed
he feared some fever had deprived her of her wits.</p>

<p>“No, I am not ill.”</p>

<p>“Then what madness is this? What nonsense!”
Nikander could hardly believe in this sudden quarrel
darkening the brightness of his day of joy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span></p>

<p>Dryas crossed over to her. He was ever the peacemaker.</p>

<p>“What has happened, Theria?” He began gently.</p>

<p>Her great eyes looked fearfully at him.</p>

<p>“You know perfectly well what has happened. How
dare you ask!”</p>

<p>Nikander was now thoroughly angry.</p>

<p>“Theria,” he said, “greet your brother at once or go
to your room. Your whims are unbearable.”</p>

<p>“Theria,” began Dryas again. But at his urging
voice her anger took flame.</p>

<p>“I won’t praise you!” she cried wildly. “You know
the song is mine, mine. I made it myself.”</p>

<p>“Great gods!” laughed Lycophron. “Here’s a pother
for you!”</p>

<p>“No pother at all,” spoke Dryas quickly. “Who’ll
believe her?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, nobody, my son,” sounded Nikander’s
deep voice. “Now, Theria, go! I shall punish you
myself for this!”</p>

<p>Here Melantho lifted horrified hands. “What jealousy,
Theria! Shame on you! Shame!”</p>

<p>Theria had already reached the stair-foot, but at this
word she faced them again.</p>

<p>“I am not jealous, I can prove that I made it,”
she said, her voice suddenly clear. “I can sing my
song.”</p>

<p>As at sacrilege, Nikander answered:</p>

<p>“Indeed you will do no such thing. Do you suppose
I would allow that perfect creation to be caricatured by
you?”</p>

<p>“Father, she heard me sing it,” thus Dryas, pale with
the hurt Theria had given. “She has a perfect memory.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>“My dear boy, do you suppose the matter needs
argument?”</p>

<p>“Oh, let her try. Why not?” came the heavy voice
of Lycophron. “Then we can finish the scene with a
good laugh, anyway.”</p>

<p>“You will not laugh at me,” cried out Theria. “By
Hermes, you will not laugh!” The look in her face,
suddenly visionary and unafraid, found response in an
unexpected quarter.</p>

<p>“Oh, let her try.” Lycophron spoke in a different
tone. “Give the poor child a chance.”</p>

<p>“Surely you need no proof,” said the father.</p>

<p>“Be damned if I don’t,” responded the elder brother.</p>

<p>“Then have your proof. It will need few moments.”</p>

<p>Nikander swiftly took the lyre from Dryas’s slave and
gave it into Theria’s hand. The girl received it with
an almost hungry eagerness as though the song within
her burned for expression. Every vestige of anger
died from her. Something from within seemed to
sweep her up into a mobile erectness, holding her delicately
steady as a flame is held aloft.</p>

<p>She struck a deep chord from the lyre upon her hip
and sang. To their astonishment, it was not Dryas’s
song though haunted ever and again with bits of the
Dryas melody. She tossed the melody from grave
to gay with ease and in the changes swayed softly.</p>

<p>At this point the rhythm with an increasing purposeful
tread marched into the very tune of Dryas. The
ancient story of Apollo slaying the Python-snake and
winning the place of the Oracle from which to speak to

<p>To the end she sang it. Not with Dryas’s sensitive
handling but with a dramatic power, possessive, from
within, making it inalienably her own.</p>

<p>Then she seemed to waken. She looked around.
Her father stood with bowed head and hidden face.
Melantho was weeping. Lycophron motioned a slave
to shut the door lest someone come upon them, and
Dryas sat gazing at the ground with an expression of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
misery and defeat which scattered the last vestige of
Theria’s creative joy.</p>

<p>Suddenly she would have given worlds not to have
sung. All kept silence as if they were all guilty. And
like a guilty thing, Theria gave the lyre back to the
slave and went up the stair.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Theria</span> was gone. Yet in the room the awkward
silence held. Then by some hidden sympathy
Nikander’s hand beckoned to Dryas and
Dryas himself started forward at the same moment.</p>

<p>“I wanted,” faltered Dryas, “oh, I wanted you to be
proud.”</p>

<p>“I would have been proud anyway,” said Nikander
loyally. Dryas began to sob.</p>

<p>“Son, why did you deceive me? There was no need.
I would never have told the judges.”</p>

<p>“I don’t care for the judges. It was you—you!”</p>

<p>With sorrowful affection Nikander kissed him, then
went slowly up the stair to Theria’s room.</p>

<p>He found her pacing up and down the narrow place.
She was talking aloud.</p>

<p>“To take away my song! It wasn’t fair. No! To
take away my song!”</p>

<p>Nikander spoke passionately: “Theria, this was the
happiest day of my life and you have made it the most
sorrowful.”</p>

<p>“Father!” she cried. “Father!”</p>

<p>She stood instantly still. Tears were running down
her face. “Oh, I was sorry the minute I had done it.
There was no use to tell and it only gave pain to everyone.”</p>

<p>Wistfully she tried to take his hand. Like most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
children, she had never told him how intensely she loved
him.</p>

<p>“I cannot understand, Theria, why you would give
your song to Dryas and then at a crucial moment
snatch it back again. Dryas has done wrong, but your
wrong is sheer cruelty.”</p>

<p>“But, Father——” she began. Then she stopped.
She had done enough harm for one day.</p>

<p>She could not tell him that she had never given the
song, but that Dryas had taken it against her will.
Dryas had come to her one morning with a song of his
own. Theria knew at once that it would never win the
prize. They had talked it over, trying to mend it.</p>

<p>That afternoon her own song had flashed upon her.
It was, as such flashes are apt to be, the culmination of
long striving and dreaming. And for days afterward
she had worked and perfected it. Then a week before the
Pythian festival she had taken the song to Dryas and had
sung it for him. Of course she was willing to give it to
him. It did not occur to her but that Dryas would
share with her the honour of it, at least in their own home.
This Dryas had refused to do. They had quarrelled,
and, at the end, Dryas had flatly told her that since
she taught him the song he would take it for his own,
whether she willed or no. He had thought she would
never dare to tell. But now she had told, and the result
was this misery.</p>

<p>“Theria,” said her father wearily, “how did it ever
occur to you to write a song?”</p>

<p>“It was just as I told in the singing, Father. I was
spinning alone in the spinning-room and the Muse
struck across my mind. She would not let me go.
The words hurried before I could catch up with them;
a new chord waited for every chord I struck.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Nikander was for a moment awed. He believed in
the Muse; no mere poetic figment was she. She was an
accepted goddess, and even thus was she wont to act.</p>

<p>“But you must have studied and worked,” he said.
“You must have had help.”</p>

<p>“Medon has helped me a little. He taught me the
scales, and I have taken your book rolls and made him
show me how to read. Do not be angry with Medon.
He is only a slave and I commanded him. It was really
myself did it. I worked very hard.”</p>

<p>Suddenly it seemed to her that some invisible door,
which ever for her, a girl, had always stood ajar, had
quietly and irrevocably closed. She had the instinct to
turn this way and that for escape. But there was no
escape.</p>

<p>“What shall I do?” she moaned. “Oh, what shall I
do?” It seemed as though her father, so intelligent, so
quick to help all comers to the Oracle, surely he would
know some help for her.</p>

<p>“My dear Theria,” said Nikander, “there is much for
you to do here at home. You have everything, why are
you unhappy?”</p>

<p>She bowed her head without answer. There was so
much to say that she could say nothing at all.</p>

<p>“Theria,” he went on kindly, “I must tell you that
only yesterday by your mother’s advice I did something
for you. I see now how necessary it was.”</p>

<p>Her lips parted as if in fear.</p>

<p>“I have offered you in marriage,” said Nikander,
“to Timon for his eldest son Theras. Timon has accepted.
I am delighted with the alliance and I shall
have the betrothal very soon.”</p>

<p>With a low cry the girl crouched upon the floor, clasping
his knees.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>“Oh, no, Father, no,” she pleaded. “You are not
so angry with me as that. Don’t send me away!
Don’t send me away!”</p>

<p>He took her hands gently and lifted her—put his arm
about her pitifully trembling shoulders.</p>

<p>“What a strange child. What a strange, foolish
child. All maidens look forward to marriage. It is
their right.”</p>

<p>“But not I, Father, not I!”</p>

<p>“You must do so. Of course it will be strange at
first. Brides are often timid, but you are not lacking in
courage. Theria, your constant dwelling upon thoughts
which are for men makes you cold toward what is your
business in life—which is marriage and childbearing.
You are mature in things not for you and in all the rest
an undeveloped child.”</p>

<p>This brutal statement was a nearer reading of
Theria’s character than Nikander himself guessed.
An unevenness of development was hers—a kind of
mental hobbledehoy which is not infrequent in high-bred
youngsters. Nay, more than this: An actual
shrinking purity was the concomitant of her poetic gift.
Other girls of Delphi discussed the facts of marriage
with primitive frankness and looked forward to marriage
as the one event to break monotony. Theria never
spoke of it, and thought of it almost with horror—the
strange house, the strange man, the mysteries from
which she hid her eyes.</p>

<p>Shall we add to this the terrific pride of youth—that
she held it a certainty that no family equalled the
Nikanders? To mate even with another Delphian was
a downward step. This pride was in her stubborn answer.</p>

<p>“Father, I cannot—I cannot.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span></p>

<p>“Nonsense,” smiled Nikander, “of course you will.
He is a good man—Timon’s son.”</p>

<p>“Have I seen him?”</p>

<p>“Daughter! Of course you have not.”</p>

<p>She wrung her hands in sudden wildness.</p>

<p>“I won’t marry,” she cried. “I won’t go away from
the house I love to one I have never known. I won’t
belong to Theras whom I have never seen. I will only
belong to you, you, you!”</p>

<p>“Theria, my dear child,” began Nikander.</p>

<p>But she was quite beside herself. She stamped the
floor with her foot.</p>

<p>“I won’t marry Theras! I won’t! I won’t!” she
raged.</p>

<p>At the end of the interview Nikander brought out a
small whip which was used for child slaves. With this
he whipped his daughter. Greek fathers had this right
even with grown sons, but Nikander had never used it.</p>

<p>At last, when she stood tall and tearless and he stood
trembling in spite of effort to keep steady, he said:</p>

<p>“Daughter, this is not for your present act alone. It
is for your year-long disobedience. I believe now that
you will obey.”</p>

<p>She stood like a straight reed, so still, so horror struck.
And in that stillness her father left her.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>An hour later Theria was roused from her apathy by
the sound of beautiful music.</p>

<p>It was in the street, and she curiously stole forward to
her father’s room to look out of the little window there.
She was in time to see Dryas borne along the way on the
shoulders of his friends.</p>

<p>The full moon of the festival made the street as bright<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
as day and the torches of the procession twinkled like
jewels in the white light. Pindar walked in the procession
chanting a strophe in Dryas’s honour. A chorus
of youths followed singing the antistrophe, and behind
these a boy played the cymbals upon which the glitter
of sound met the lovely glitter of the moonlight.</p>

<p>Leaning out of the window, Theria suddenly exulted.
“It is <em>my</em> song Pindar is praising. All those words are
for me and it is Pindar, Pindar!”</p>

<p>In a burst of joyous music they passed within the
house door below her, and Theria heard the pleasant
confusion as they took their seats at the board and the
scurry of the slaves beginning to serve them.</p>

<p>Then after a time came a faint tuning of a lyre, a
pause, and Dryas started once more to sing his song—her
song. He faltered. Oh, would her rumpus of the
afternoon make him fail? She was in a panic—family
pride, family affection were strong in the Nikander
household—but after a little flickering Dryas’s
flame burned bright. He even imitated his sister’s
dramatic singing of the afternoon.</p>

<p>Theria could not hear Pindar’s exclamation of wonder
that the lad should sing the song this evening with an
entirely new meaning. She heard only the hand clappings,
the mingled voices, the chitter of the silver cups—cups
treasured many a year by successive Nikander
housewives. A wave of loneliness swept over her—a
Wave of fear, remembering her father’s purpose. And
shrinking back from the window she made her way
through the darkness to her room and bed.</p>

<span class="smaller">THERIA, SEVEN YEARS OLD</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">A little</span> girl in an ancestral house—a slender,
vivid, flashing little girl whom yet the rich
traditions of her line filled to the brim with
dreams—such had been Theria in her childhood.</p>

<p>The town in which she was born had not grown
haphazard, had not been founded for trade nor for its
nearness to some natural wealth.</p>

<p>Its central life was the god, the god of light and of
enlightenment, of beauty and judicial fairness. Apollo
was its source of happiness and its livelihood as well.
He moulded the daily life. The focus of all Delphi
was the shrine where, from a windy cleft beneath the
temple, Apollo spoke, answering the wistful questions
of men.</p>

<p>And of such an idealizing force it is true, that while it
affects the community as a whole, it gives to certain
individuals a heaped-up gift. Such a gift was upon this
child, peculiar to her in Nikander’s house. Delphi
had imprinted that expression on her baby face, that
unmistakable look of spiritual life which had been the
life of her fathers for at least four hundred years. So
many traditions, so many prides, upliftings, adventures,
poetries, and faiths, entering into the heart of a little
girl. Nikander’s sons were just hearty, playful Greek
boys. Theria was a Delphian.</p>

<p>One spring morning, when all Delphi was joyous with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
an awakening sky and earth, it happened that Theria
was seven years old. She came tripping down the
stairway of the inner court, fresh-washed from the
hands of her nurse, fresh-dressed in a single garment
which did not reach her knees.</p>

<p>“Now be good,” the old nurse had admonished her
as she gave the last touch to her dark curls. “Your
twin brother is playin’ that sweet down in the aula.
Don’t ye go now and stir him up with your mischievous
ways.”</p>

<p>And here in the court sure enough Dryas was playing
“that sweet.” He had made a circle of pebbles and
stones and was marching around and around it chanting
some childish, made-up thing—perfectly absorbed, unseeing.
Sunbeams slanted across the court leaving him
in a sort of magic, refracted light; small rain-pools here
and there among the worn pavement-flags gave back
the blue, or wrinkled suddenly from the unseen breeze.
In the corner the old, old tiny altar, upon which many
generations of Nikanders had sacrificed, breathed yet
the smoke of the morning rite. The place smelt sweet
of wood-smoke. Now Theria was aware of a shadow
moving across the court and looking up saw an eagle
swoop down the sunlit air.</p>

<p>In after years Theria—a woman and far away—was
to recall this scene cut clear and deep by the love she
bore her home, but now she tripped recklessly down the
unbalustered stair and scattered Dryas’s circle of stones
with her foot.</p>

<p>“Let’s play,” she announced.</p>

<p>“<em>Am</em> playin’—threshin’-floor,” responded Dryas,
breathless from circling.</p>

<p>“You don’t play threshing-floor now. That’s past.”</p>

<p>The Threshing-Floor was an ancient circular platform<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
in the Precinct of Apollo. Every four years a sacred
drama of the Python-snake was performed upon it and
this year little Dryas had seen it.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you,” said the disturbing Theria, “you fetch
more stones. We’ll make the village and the road that
goes by to the Oracle.”</p>

<p>The Oracle was the treasury of beauty and wonder
of all Hellas, but to Delphic children it was just a dear
bright place within high walls and the scene of their
holidays.</p>

<p>Dryas did not answer, but he stopped his play and
trotted off toward the outer room, which led to the front
door, for the pebbles.</p>

<p>Theria waited impatiently while he brought in skirtful
after skirtful of stones. Then she began to make her
village, a stone for each well-known house, a line of little
stones to show the road which passed their own door
and ran windingly along the mountain slope. Theria
set her miniature precinct in the sunny part of the court.
To her the sunlight always and inevitably rested on
that temple place where fane after fane and shrine after
shrine mounted the hillside up to the matchless Apollo
temple itself, set like a jewel of red and peacock-blue
and gold against the shining cliffs.</p>

<p>“The Sacred Way,” murmured Dryas happily as
he made the path between the temples. “Here it
turns—an’ oh, here’s a sparkly stone for the ’Thenian
Treasury.”</p>

<p>“The Knidian Treasury,” corrected Theria. “It’s the
Knidian Treasury at the turn.”</p>

<p>“No—’Thenian!”</p>

<p>“No, don’t you remember the pretty marble ladies
who hold up the porch?”</p>

<p>Still Dryas maintained his Athenian Treasury.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span></p>

<p>“Shu! You’ve never been there,” he said, “an’ I’ve
been there lots o’ times.”</p>

<p>“I go every day,” announced the little girl.</p>

<p>At this evident whopper Dryas’s rosy mouth fell
open in dismay.</p>

<p>“Never have you been there. You are only a
girl.”</p>

<p>“I go there every day,” repeated Theria.</p>

<p>Quarrel was imminent; was averted only by Dryas
scrambling to his feet to seek old Medon as judge.</p>

<p>“Never mind Medon, I’ll show you how I go,” and,
taking her twin brother’s hand with an air of great
bestowing, Theria led him up stairs and forward
to her father’s bedchamber, to its one window. Out
of this she leaned so far that only her chubby legs remained
within. Sure enough, so leaning she could
see beyond the shoulder of a cliff a spur of farther hill,
and there in a bath of light the golden tip-edge of a
little temple and on a higher level a single pillar bearing
a sphynx of lofty wings.</p>

<p>“I see it every day,” she announced again.</p>

<p>“Only a little piece,” said Dryas contemptuously.</p>

<p>“When I see that I see all,” repeated the child enthusiast.
“Medon has told me all.”</p>

<p>Dryas opened his lips to answer but thought better
of it. Theria was a most determined little person when
once she had made up her mind.</p>

<p>They went back to the aula. Here ruin met them.
Baltè, the old nurse, was sweeping up their shrine of
Apollo in great indignation.</p>

<p>“Whatever made ye litter up the aula like this?” She
complained. “Rubble and rubbish when the rain
washed all so clean last night. Never ye mind. I’ll
be rid o’ <em>one</em> of ye after to-day.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span></p>

<p>Dryas did not notice this speech but Theria looked
up in alarm.</p>

<p>“Which one?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Never ye mind. There; I should not ’a’
spoken.”</p>

<p>“Why shouldn’t you spoken?”</p>

<p>Such caution was unusual in Baltè. The threat
sounded real. Theria caught Baltè’s skirt.</p>

<p>“Is something goin’ to happen?”</p>

<p>“There, don’t you worry, darlin’. It won’t be you,”
said the old nurse as she hurried away.</p>

<p>Dryas had rescued enough stones to recommence his
threshing-floor. To tell truth, he had preferred this all
along.</p>

<p>Theria sat beside him watching his play. The “something”
was not going to happen to herself. Then surely
it would happen to Dryas. Her heart began to yearn
over her brother with that frightened tenderness which
children know. She leaned over and kissed him.
Dryas wiped off the kiss in frank disgust.</p>

<p>“Don’t,” he said.</p>

<p>She remembered the eagle. There was no bird so
sure of omen as an eagle.</p>

<p>“Dryas,” she said softly, “I’ll tell you a story now.”</p>

<p>“No—please.”</p>

<p>Yet Theria lingered. Dreadful it was that she could
do nothing for her brother when the eagle would so soon
be carrying him away.</p>

<p>“I wish you would let me,” she said faintly. “I’ll
give you all my honey cake at noon if you will.”</p>

<p>To such a bribe Dryas consented, squatting down in
a chubby heap beside his pebbles.</p>

<p>“It’s about baby Hermes,” Theria began. “First,
he was born, and when he was three hours old he got out<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
of his cradle and walked straight up Parnassos Mountain—to
the very top.”</p>

<p>“He couldn’t,” objected her auditor.</p>

<p>“But god-legs is strong.”</p>

<p>“Presè’s got a baby three months old and it can’t
walk yet. Its worse’n a puppy.”</p>

<p>“Presè’s a slave. Slave legs is different.”</p>

<p>“But even a god, he couldn’t do it.”</p>

<p>And though Theria knew her story was correct, she
did not press the point.</p>

<p>“And little Hermes found some cows,” she went on.
“Oh, beautiful wild cows with sharpy-sharp horns. All
the cows were white and were eating white flowers that
grow in the meadows up against the sky.”</p>

<p>“Clouds?” suggested Dryas.</p>

<p>“Yes, clouds were their food,” went on Theria who
knew the tale by rote. “For they were the herd of
Apollo. And the little baby called the cows and they
left their white flowers and came; for who can resist
the call of a god? And Hermes, swift of foot——”</p>

<p>“Three-hours-old foot,” interposed Dryas.</p>

<p>“—leaped down the path, and all the cows they
followed him. And when he came to the deep forest he
sacrificed the cows to his father, Zeus, and the smoke
went up through the trees to heaven and smelt very
sweet. Then Hermes found a tortoise, and out of the
tortoise and the cows’ pretty horns he made a lyre—oh,
the first, first lyre that ever was made. And the baby
Hermes began to play on the lyre—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span></p>

<p>“Here, here!” came an unexpected voice. “It’s very
well to compare Pindar to Hermes but your father is
another matter.”</p>

<p>The children scrambled to their feet with faces of
delight. It was rare to see their father at this hour.
And Father always brought gaiety.</p>

<span class="smaller">ELEUTHERIA LOOKS OUT OF A WINDOW</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Nikander</span> was a tall slender man, a remarkable
uniting of sensitiveness and force. Twelve
generations of his forbears had been priests of
Delphi, statesmen of wide outlook and ministers to the
souls of men. Nikander was a resultant type.</p>

<p>He sat down on a stone bench lifting Dryas to his
knee, but Theria crept into the hollow of his arm. Her
fears took flight like scattered birds. No harm could
come to Dryas now that her father was there.</p>

<p>“And what day, think you, is this?” he asked.
Birthdays were not so important in those days and the
children did not know.</p>

<p>“It is Dryas’s birthday,” he told them.</p>

<p>“Then my birthday, too,” exclaimed Theria, for
though she was taller and seemed older than her brother,
she was his twin.</p>

<p>“Yes, yours, too.” Quite unconscious of his act,
Nikander bent and kissed the little girl. So bending,
his face was the mature model for her own.</p>

<p>“And because it is the seventh birthday it is to be the
first day of school. Medon will take you, Dryas. He
will be pedagogue. And here is your little lyre. Father
bought it to-day of the old lyre maker. See what a
pretty picture is here beneath the strings. And for you,
my daughter, what you have wanted so long.”</p>

<p>He drew from behind the bench the ropes and seat of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
a swing. “But I wanted a lyre, too,” said Theria with
wide, blank eyes.</p>

<p>“A lyre for a little girl! Oh, no, kitten. Besides,
did you not ask for a swing?”</p>

<p>“But, oh, Father, it is the lyre I want.”</p>

<p>“Theria must not be envious,” said her father seriously.
“That would be a new fault in my little girl.”</p>

<p>But her wide, astonished eyes disturbed him and
again he kissed the child before he hurried out.</p>

<p>Dryas with little cluckings of delight plucked at his
toy, but Theria stood very still. Since she was to have
no lyre, was it also true that she was not to go to school?</p>

<p>She seemed in the presence of a calamity which had
been approaching since all the days she had been alive,
and now was come. With the vagueness of her seven
years, yet very deeply, she knew that not going to
school meant the parting of the ways between her and
Dryas, the closing away from her of precious things.
Yet, strangely enough, in her surface, childish self, she
did not believe it at all.</p>

<p>Father had not said she could not go. Besides, she
had always got what she wanted if she persisted. She
knew from her big brother Lycophron what the school
was like—a room or portico up near the Precinct, the
master teaching Homer all the day long—wonderful
stories which one could not forget, boys playing their
lyres merrily then hanging them upon the wall to go
out and leap and race in contest in the sunshine. Lycophron
had gone to school since the beginning of the
world.</p>

<p>Theria did not associate Baltè’s warning with this
matter at all.</p>

<p>“I go to school to-day,” she began to say softly to
herself. “Then I must hurry.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>With a certain anxiety she crossed the court to
Lycophron’s room. Yes, there on the chest were his
extra stylus and tablets and hanging on the wall a
small lyre which in a temper he had broken.</p>

<p>Theria climbed the chest and got it.</p>

<p>And in possession of these things confidence came to
her. She was perfectly sure now that she should go to
school. She began to hum briskly to herself. She
went back into the court to be near Dryas lest when
Medon come he forget her.</p>

<p>Dryas was prancing about, hugging his lyre. He was
not slow to taunt her.</p>

<p>“Ai: I’m going to school. You can’t go; you can’t
go!”</p>

<p>“I can. Father said I could. I heard him.”</p>

<p>“When did he say it?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know when, but I heard him! ‘Daughter,
you are going to school; you are seven years old!
Everybody goes to school then.’”</p>

<p>“He didn’t give you the lyre. He gave it to me,”
gloried Dryas.</p>

<p>“I’ve a lyre, too, foolish one.” She held it out.</p>

<p>“Ai, what a broken thing, and it’s Lycophron’s. It’s
none of yours.”</p>

<p>“If I had a lyre I’d play it, not hug it,” retorted
Theria.</p>

<p>Here Medon came into the aula with sandals on.
To Theria it was a thunder-clap. She watched him
steadily as he crossed to them, then with loving
gesture slipped her hand into his.</p>

<p>“But,” said the slave, “my darling is not going to-day.
It’s Dryas who must go. Poor Dryas!”</p>

<p>“Oh, no: you didn’t understand,” she reasoned with
him. “Father wants me to go.” She pushed back<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
her curls with a nervous little gesture and looked
brightly up at him.</p>

<p>Medon dreaded a battle with Theria. The child had
a storm-like temper. To be sure it broke seldom, but
it was always on some bright day like this and nearly
always had to do with going out of the house—a
privilege rare for little girls. Most girls did not expect
to go out. Theria always expected it, like a boy, and
fought for it like a boy, too. Something told him she
was going to fight now. He must do his best.</p>

<p>“Medon will buy you a hoop in the market—a hoop,
mind you, with bells—if you will be good.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want that.” How tight she held his hand
and how black were the childish eyes gazing up at him.
“I’ll tell you, Medon, you can give the hoop to
Dryas. School will be hard for Dryas. It’s going to
be so easy for me.”</p>

<p>“But, my dear little mistress, you cannot go. There
are no girls at the school.”</p>

<p>Medon felt the hand tighten sharply in his. The
child was looking off at a distance. Then with complete
change she slipped her hand out of his.</p>

<p>“Yes, you and Dryas go,” she said.</p>

<p>She ran quickly up the stair to the women’s apartments—no
doubt to cry alone, and Medon, seizing his
opportunity, fairly fled with his charge from the house.</p>

<p>Medon carried the little boy’s lyre and very peacefully
they walked along the road toward the Precinct.
They had gone some distance when Medon heard running
steps behind him, and, turning, saw to his amazement
Theria as if on wings, her black hair streaming
behind, her chubby arms clasping a lyre.</p>

<p>“I’m going!” she cried. “I will; I will!”</p>

<p>And then it was that Medon had to carry back along<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
the road a strange wild creature that fought and kicked
and bit and clutched at his hair.</p>

<p>The neighbours hearing the cries ran out of their
houses and shook their heads at Nikander’s terrible child.
Poor Medon was like to drop into the earth for shame.
Yet amid all the tumult he kept thinking of a mountain
stream which had been dammed back but which one
day broke through and rushed away—a mighty flood.</p>

<p>Nikander’s alarmed family—wife, slaves, and all—met
them at the door.</p>

<p>“Now for what do the gods punish me?” cried poor
Melantho, “that I should have such a child! Look at
her eyes. She is beside herself. Baltè, hold her!”</p>

<p>But as Medon set down the little raging tumult old
Baltè let her escape. Up the stairs she flew, her voice
like a clarion.</p>

<p>“Leave her be, dear mistress,” pleaded wise old Baltè.
“Remember, she is a twin child and it does grieve her
sore to be separate from her twin.”</p>

<p>In the farthest room of the house Theria found refuge
and slammed the door. Here she threw herself face
downward and beat the floor with her fists; yes, and
kicked, too, as her childish grief surged to and fro within
her. Her strength spent itself at last and she fell to
sobbing, suffering now as she had not done amid the
curious enjoyment of loud woe.</p>

<p>Her thoughts now were not of the school nor of Dryas,
but of her father, the strange horror that her father
should have done this and not seem to care. Always
before this had he mended hurts, not made them. Facing
this mystery her dearest faith tottered. Yet after
a while even this dread grew faint. Thoughts faded into
fancies. Then she fell asleep.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>She must have slept a long while for she awoke
strangely quiet. Her refuge place was a storeroom.
Chests stood about full of things used only at festivals.
There were also great earthen jars of grain and wine.</p>

<p>The room was stone floored, stone walled, but its far
end was hewn into the native rock. Nikander’s house,
standing on a side hill, was two storied in front but
here at the back melted to the roof in the hillside. This
room had a little low window—the only other window
in the house besides that in Nikander’s room.</p>

<p>To this window the little girl crept, and leaned her
two elbows on the ledge, her chin in her hands. The
window showed her only the side lane which led up
between the houses to lose itself in the hill above. This
lane was wider than most of the lanes in Delphi, for it had
been chosen by one of the mountain streams for a bed,
and now in the springtime the foaming waters dashed
downward between the house walls beside the footpath.</p>

<p>There was no sound in the lane save the happy speaking
of the waters. An amber light lay over all as if the
sun were setting, and in this rich light everything stood
distinct: ferns, rocks, and the tiny flowers on the mossy
roof of Cousin Phaino’s house across the lane. Every
little wave as it lifted in the stream turned golden and
as it dived under again seemed to peep at Theria and
laugh. Presently a child came down from the upper
hills into the lane. What could so small a child have been
doing up there alone in that wilderness of crags? But
what a lovely child he was, what brave, erect little
shoulders and rounded legs and what a mischievous,
dream-haunted face! How fearlessly he leaped along!
He was only a baby. Oh, why should he not leap?
Wings were on his heels and two golden wings in his
cap—Hermes, and no other!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span></p>

<p>To Theria it was not strange that Hermes should thus
stroll down Nikander’s lane. Not strange, but it made
her very glad. Now the dear Hermes child paused by
the stream, laid his tortoise lyre to his arm, and began
to play. Theria had never heard such music. It was
clear like the amber light and filled her with a joy that
was to glisten softly down all her years. Yet it was very
faint, that music. She had to strain her ears to hear.</p>

<p>Presently under its rhythm the stream grew more
turbulent. The waves dashed higher and turned to
foaming white. And suddenly from each white wave
where it tossed in swift succession there swam out into
the air nymphs white as the foam, slender as flowers,
immortally fair.</p>

<p>Theria knew it was right for them to come. Nymphs
were always the nursemaids of infant gods. Little
Hermes must not wander alone, god though he be.
How delicately they kissed him, bending over him, then
rising, circling up and away as if carried by the breeze.
Hermes was safe now no matter how rough the way.</p>

<p>Suddenly a step sounded in the lane, “clump clump,”
coming nearer.</p>

<p>The nymphs and Hermes stopped still, listing as
hares do in the path. Then instantly, thus poised,
they vanished.</p>

<p>“Lentils—good lentils, who’ll buy?” came the call
of old Labba, the market woman, so tired with her day’s
work, tramping home to her poor scraggy farm in the
hills.</p>

<p>Theria watched her. Poor Labba! She could not
see the gods. Labba climbed the hill and was lost to
view. Theria looked again.</p>

<p>Yes—at once, as though bursting out of invisible pods,
they came again, and with them the music so elfin clear.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
The nymphs formed a circle and danced, with feet
which did not touch the rocks, around their baby god.
Sometimes they circled above the stream, sometimes
swept near under Theria’s very window. So they
danced and danced.</p>

<p>Baltè, searching anxiously through the house for her
nurseling, found her at length in the far shadowy room.
She was sitting by the window, her head resting on the
window ledge over which was strewn loose her night-dark
hair.</p>

<p>She was sound asleep.</p>

<p>“An’ I only wish,” said Baltè afterward to Medon,
“you could ’a’ seen the smile on her face. You wouldn’t
’a’ thought this very mornin’ she was like a whole crew
o’ mænads!”</p>

Fortunate was it then that the house was rich in
memories. Rich otherwise it was not. No
earnest Greek beautified his own house when he could
beautify instead the house and temple of his deathless
gods. So the walls of Nikander’s house were of plain
stucco, its floors, worn flags.</p>

<p>To be sure the furniture, handed down from olden
days, was beautiful. The bedsteads were chastely carved,
their coverings were of home-made purple, and Melantho’s
chair in which she sat to spin was of exquisite
shape and balance. The tables in the men’s
aula, where Nikander feasted his guests, were of teak-wood
brought from afar by some travelled merchant
to the Pythian feast. The vases in every room and put
to all possible uses were of a grace and workmanship
which only the Greeks knew. They were of the
ordinary make, which everyone afforded, from the
Delphi pottery below the hill. Upon them were painted
pictures of the heroes and the gods—Theria’s charming
picture books which sometimes told whole stories.</p>

<p>The plain old house had been built upon, lived in, and
loved by a dozen generations of Nikanders. It had
absorbed within itself the beauty of their daily life and
seemed to give it forth again—a sort of fragrance to be
sensed the moment you crossed the threshold. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
Nikanders were one of those quiet families of exceeding
excellence and highmindedness which always exist
in great numbers in the background of an age of genius.</p>

<p>Time had harmonized the house. The lines of wall
and ceiling were no longer plumb and level. The grey
stucco had been stained lavender, yellow, faint rose by
lichen growths. No threshold in the house but was
worn deep by the tread of feet now passed beyond. In
front of the little altar to Hestia the stone floor was
hollowed like a bowl, where father and son, father and
son had stood to offer reverent sacrifice to the goddess
of the hearth.</p>

<p>Into this atmosphere Theria had been born and in it
her spirit grew, keeping itself alive within the straitened,
prescribed round.</p>

<p>But through the house were also wafted deep draughts
of life from the Oracle—that mysterious shrine which
seems to us like some myth, but which to the Greek was
business-real.</p>

<p>The manner of divination at Delphi was peculiar in
that it gave the priests an opportunity to mould the
divine answer without at the same time losing faith in
its divineness. The Priestess or Pythoness was a simple
girl comprehending nothing of the knowledge which she
must impart. In preparation for the day of oracle she
was subjected to three days of rite. She fasted, drank
of the sacred spring, walked through laurel smoke;
and with her perfect faith in these rites, she must often
have been in the ecstatic state before mounting the
tripod.</p>

<p>Then in the shadowy adytum beneath the temple
she was placed upon the golden tripod, the “High
Perilous Seat” as it was called. The cold wind blew
out of the cleft below her and in ecstasy she spoke words<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
she knew not. It is undoubted that in her state of
suspended consciousness she often reflected as in a
mirror the knowledge and judgments of the priests.
Her marvellous answers often filled priests and
questioners alike with awe. The priests afterward
were allowed to recast the answers into verse and to
remould them. But in spite of the liberty which they
occasionally felt obliged to use in the recasting the
priests sincerely believed that the responses were genuinely
from the god.</p>

<p>It was this mingling of faith and liberty which gave
Delphi her power, a power which was for the most part
grandly used. At the dawn of Hellas, from this eerie
mountain glen the authority began to be exercised.
It continued down through all the glory of Hellas and
for centuries after her decline. Strong and real indeed
must have been the religious impetus which could outlast
the race.</p>

<p>This was the Oracle which Theria’s kin had served
with singleness of heart. Her father, Nikander, served
it now. Priest, yes, but priest in the joyous, free fashion
of the Greek. In performance of his priestly duties
to the Oracle Nikander had travelled far, studying the
coasts of the Ægean, Mediterranean, and Euxine
seas, wherever lay the colonies of Delphi’s founding.
He had mingled with the barbarians or un-hellenic peoples
and had even learned some of their languages—a
sort of knowledge unknown in Greece. In Thrace he
had sojourned with the rude tent dwellers, in Egypt
he had visited the stately temples of Isis and Osiris and
had seen the great Sphynx which so grimly faced the
desert. In Persia he had visited the court of Xerxes
and despised its luxury. He had returned to Delphi
broadened and sweetened by his experiences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span></p>

<p>Among the narrow one-city men of Greece the Delphian
was not provincial.</p>

<p>Nikander was a member of that Council, presided over
by Delphi, called “Amphyction,” which for hundreds
of years had upheld the only international law that
Hellas recognized. The Amphyctiony earnestly tried
to keep peace between the passionate cities which were
its members. Nikander personally had great influence
in this Council and used that influence for the constant
uplifting of the policy of the Oracle.</p>

<p>Nikander brought with him into his home the very
breath of the Oracle. He spent little time at home, but
when he did come his children ran to him, for no one
could tell such wonder stories as Nikander—stories of
shipwreck on savage coasts, of mountains that flamed
and smoked, of the great statue Memnon which stood
in Egypt and sang when the sun rose. But for the most
part Nikander’s tales were tales of Delphi. Delphi
was so rich in tradition that Nikander needed never to
go far afield for his stories.</p>

<p>It was from her father that Theria heard of the beautiful
coming of her own ancestors to Delphi, men
brought by Apollo himself to be his worshippers.</p>

<p>“They were in a ship on a trading voyage,” Nikander
would relate, “those ancestors of ours, bold young men,
unafraid of the sea, for they were Cretan islanders.
When suddenly there leaped out of the waves a Dolphin,
golden and bright, and lay on their deck. At
once the wind changed, speeding them toward the west.
They tried to shift their sails but not one whit could
they shift their course. The men were sore afraid for
they knew they were in the hands of a god.”</p>

<p>“The Dolphin god,” Theria would murmur with
Wide eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, the Delphian,” her father made the age-old
pun. “And they saw the immortal creature shimmer
with rainbow colours never ceasing. So the strong
wind blew them against their will first westward then
northward into our own lovely gulf and to our port of
Krissa. Here the ship stopped, held by immortal hands.</p>

<p>“Then at once the Dolphin disappeared and in his
stead stood a young man strong and beautiful with
golden locks out-sprayed upon the winds and eyes
whose light was as the dawn of day.”</p>

<p>Theria would clap her hands softly, saying, “And he
leaped upon the shore, our dear Apollo, and beckoned
the men with his hand.” She knew the tale by heart.</p>

<p>Nikander would continue, smiling:</p>

<p>“And Apollo, lightly stepping, playing upon his
heavenly lyre, led the Cretans hither, right by the place
where our house now stands and up to the ‘place of
golden tripods’ yonder.</p>

<p>“‘This is to be yours,’ he told the Cretans. ‘Here
shall ye serve my oracle.’</p>

<p>“Then the Cretans looked about them. They saw
the sterile cliffs and rocky hillsides on which nothing
would grow. And they asked in apprehension:</p>

<p>“‘How can we live in this place, O Lord Apollo?
Here will no grain grow, no cattle find fodder. Here
we cannot fish.’”</p>

<p>The children laughed at this.</p>

<p>“Fish! O foolish, foolish Cretans!”</p>

<p>“Yes, foolish Cretans. So Apollo called them. ‘Do
ye so love to delve in the earth, and sweat? Do ye so
love to be buffeted by salt water and bitter winds? A
secret I will tell you! Sit ye here, attend my worship,
and all the nations of the earth shall bring you gifts.
My altars shall smoke with the fat of lambs, my<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
temples glow with golden things. But your duty shall
be to guard my temple and to receive kindly in my
name the tribes of men who gather here.</p>

<p>“‘But if any of you ill-treat the stranger, if ye do
violence or speak harsh words, then shall others be your
masters and make you slaves for ever.’”</p>

<p>“But we will never be slaves?” Theria would inquire
anxiously. “We will never do those wicked deeds
and be slaved?”</p>

<p>“No, never.” Nikander would kiss the child who
cuddled so close in his arms and then with yet more
fondness kiss his son Dryas.</p>

<p>Such was the ennobling tradition which the little
girl Theria treasured in her heart. But she knew, too,
that the Delphi god had not always been master of his
shrine. Story upon story, faith upon faith went back
into the misty past where the chaste belief in Apollo
was underlaid with grotesque stories of Gaia—Mother
Earth—and dragons.</p>

<p>It was from her nurse Baltè that she heard these older
tales though they were sternly and fearfully believed by
all Delphians.</p>

<p>Baltè one afternoon found the little girl sitting by
Nikander’s front window gazing outward in silence. It
was a place of wide prospect. The house was one of
the few which stood above the main road, and so steep
was the incline that the roofs across the way seemed but
little higher than the road itself. Theria could look
over them and over other roofs in sharp downward
succession into the violet depth of Pleistos gorge and
then up to the fir-clad mountain beyond.</p>

<p>A storm of clear-edged cloud was sweeping along
that slope with flashes and mutterings. She watched
wistfully its swiftness and its strength.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_40"></a>[40]</span></p>

<p>Baltè came from behind and kissed her.</p>

<p>“Now an’ why aren’t ye down in the aula playin’
with Clitè an’ Nerea? It’s always I find ye by yourself
at the window. It isn’t right for little girls to be seen
from the street.”</p>

<p>But Theria was full of questions. “Baltè, what does
the glen find when it goes down into the shadows? It
always seems to stoop down and down.”</p>

<p>“The river, do ye mean, darlin’?”</p>

<p>“But I can’t see the river, I’ve tried so many days.”</p>

<p>“No, the glen is too deep to see the Pleistos.”</p>

<p>“Baltè, did you ever go across the river to the other
mountain—far, far over where Father Zeus has driven
his clouds?”</p>

<p>“No, child, not I. What ever would I be doin’
there?”</p>

<p>“I’d like to go,” said the child.</p>

<p>“Don’t ye never! Do ye see that little rift-like all
black on the mountainside among the firs?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Baltè.”</p>

<p>“Well, down in that rift is the cave o’ Lamia—a
woman the upper part of her, but all the rest a <em>snake</em>.
In the olden time she did come hitherward and ravaged
the country.”</p>

<p>“What’s ravid?”</p>

<p>“Oh, knockin’ down the houses and eatin’ the folk.
So at last to quiet her they did take a boy—oh, a nice
likely young boy of the village—and leave him for her in
that cave.”</p>

<p>“What for?”</p>

<p>“To eat! Every day a boy!”</p>

<p>By this time Theria’s eyes were wide, and she reached
furtively and caught Baltè’s skirt.</p>

<p>“But then there came the hero Eurymalos an’ he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
walked right into the cave, he did. An’ he caught
Lamia and pulled her out, and cast her down the cliff.
Then she fell down, down, a-bumpin’ and bangin’ her
head all the way—right into the river Pleistos.”</p>

<p>“Paian be praised!” breathed the little girl.</p>

<p>“Yes, but them kind don’t stay killed,” said Baltè
uncomfortingly. “Look at the other one, the Python
now. Apollo killed her long since. But every fourth
year the Sacred Boy has to go up there in the Precinct
an’ kill her again.”</p>

<p>“But, Baltè, that’s only a play to make a holy memory
to the god.” Theria felt sure of this, for not long ago
her cousin had been the Sacred Boy in the play and she
had heard Mother say that if Dryas continued to do so
well in school, and if he grew graceful and fair, he,
too, might some day be the “Boy of The Strepterion
Drama.” She somehow felt sure that Dryas could not
kill a real Python.</p>

<p>But Baltè shook her head.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me!” she said stoutly. “Ye haven’t
seen her. I have. I’ve seen the switch o’ the Python’s
tail, an’ heard her teeth grind, the while she dies. An’
when she is dead, don’t they perform all the purifications
just as when old mistress died in the house? She’s
real, I tell ye!”</p>

<p>Theria was more than half convinced.</p>

<p>Yet even the Python and the boy-eating Lamia did
not so strike terror to the childish Theria as did the
strange rites which through winter months occupied the
Delphians. These were no tales of the past but rites
of Dionysos which Theria herself could see.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the winter came Dionysos, a powerful god, to take
possession of the Precinct while Apollo should be away<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
in the north. Then Theban women—a large company—arrived
in Delphi to greet him. Theria saw
them pass and knew that a like company from Athens
was arriving at the other end of the village.</p>

<p>A society of Delphian ladies never else seen publicly
came crowding out of their houses into the highway.
From her favoured window Theria saw these also, her
own kinswomen whom she knew well, no longer sedate
and kind and neat, but with hair disordered, clad in
strange spotted fawn skins over their chitons. They
came leaping, shouting, whirling around in a sort of
frenzy as though unable to wait for the rites which
they were about to perform. They were no longer
themselves, they were possessed by the strange god
Dionysos. They were no longer called women, but
Bacchantes. They were being swept along by a terrible
joy from which the child shrank in shame though she
could not understand.</p>

<p>On one such evening Theria watched them, saw the
chill, dusky street aflare with their torches, saw how the
eyes of the Bacchantes caught the light, staring like the
eyes of panthers. Then in a frenzied, noisy rout they
rushed away.</p>

<p>Theria sat by her window quivering while the cold
yellow light died out on glen and mountain. Then
quickly she left the window and stole down to the aula
where she sat close to the Hestia fire. One of those
first evenings of frost it was when instinctively men
draw near to their hearth and wish to have about them
the home faces and the comfortable voices of home.
Yet the little girl knew that her Aunt Eunomia, her
pretty cousin Clodora, and the rest, were speeding half-naked
up Parnassos, there in the bitter uplands and the
wild to rage madly to and fro at the will of the god.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span></p>

<p>Lycophron burst into the room, rosy with the cold,
rude as fourteen years could make him.</p>

<p>“Did you see the women?” he shouted. “By the
gods, I could hardly get home for them. Free at last—that’s
what they are, havin’ the time of their lives.
Dionysos is only an excuse. Hey, Theria, you are always
wanting to get out. Why don’t you join?”</p>

<p>Lycophron did not see his father who had just come
down the stair.</p>

<p>“Lycophron,” said the father sternly, “how do you
dare such insolence? Let me never hear such from you
again.”</p>

<p>And Lycophron disappeared more suddenly than he
had come.</p>

<p>Nikander drew near the fire, absently warming his
hands. Even at this early time he was disturbed over
his eldest son.</p>

<p>“Are they gone?” queried the little girl.</p>

<p>“The Bacchantes? Yes, my child. As I came up
the street I saw far up on the mountain their Bacchic
fires gleaming through the dusk. It is cold for the
night of Bromios.”</p>

<p>Theria knew of what he was thinking—a little great-great-aunt
of hers who had died on a night like this,
in the cold of the Parnassian rocks. A tiny room next
to Theria’s own had belonged to her and she was said
to visit it on Bromios night, a white, chattering figure
trying in vain to warm herself amid the purple covering
of the couch.</p>

<p>Theria stole to her father’s side, slipped her hand In
his, and drew him down to whisper:</p>

<p>“Father, must I be a Bacchante some day?”</p>

<p>“God forbid,” spoke Nikander, then added piously,
“unless the god demand you, Theria.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span></p>

<p>“But he will not demand me. Oh, Father, he will
not?”</p>

<p>Again she was in the hollow of his arm and again felt
safe even from the god Dionysos himself.</p>

<p>“No, my daughter,” he said, looking into the sane
little face. “I do not believe he will.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE GUESTS</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">So throughout</span> the winter months Dionysos,
that god who came from far Asia into
Greece, held sway in Delphi. Apollo was gone
on his distant mysterious journey to the land of the
Hyperboreans, those happy, luxurious folk who live
on the farther side of the north wind. Theria felt
keenly this absence of her god: more keenly perhaps
than she would have felt the absence of any person in
the household.</p>

<p>For with Apollo’s going the Oracle was silenced. No
pilgrims came to consult it. The pure, ordered songs
of Apollo, the throbbing lyre, the announcing trumpets
were stilled. Instead sounded the nervous wailing of
Dionysos pipes. On quiet evenings Theria could hear
them, and Baltè told her of the furious satyr dances in
the Precinct. And now the absence of Apollo brought
the rains and the cold. Yes, in the winter Theria
missed her god.</p>

<p>When, therefore, in the spring Apollo returned, the
whole heart of the little girl went forth to him in love.
Theria knew well how her god must look. Every vase
and kylix in the house bore pictures of Apollo. And
long ago her child mind had selected, from among the
beautiful youths she had seen come by on pilgrimage,
one who seemed to her like the god himself. Always
at the word “Apollo” Theria saw again that fresh-hearted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
happy boy moving, flushed and expectant,
toward the Precinct, and on his face that same look of
dear surprise, youth’s first response to life.</p>

<p>Apollo always arrived at Delphi on his birthday the
seventh of Busious. Then the whole Precinct and the
town awoke to greet him with song and festival. In
Nikander’s house slaves ran to and fro on busy errands;
for of a surety guests would be coming from the ends of
the earth. The purples and the woven curtains came
forth from Theria’s familiar storeroom, and all the
house glowed with the patterns and pictures of tapestries.
What joy to the little girl that busyness and
commotion.</p>

<p>Past the house on the highroad now came throngs of
pilgrims, more of them every day. At these times no
forbiddings or punishments could keep Theria away
from the window.</p>

<p>Here came men from Corinth, Thebes, Argos, and the
islands of the sea. Rich men on horseback with trains
of slaves, poor men whose anxious faces showed plain
their question to the god. “Even the wolves bring
gifts to Delphi,” was the saying; and some of these with
their heavy mountain faces and clothes of skin seemed
wild and wolf-like to the little girl. Now would pass a
delegation from some distant Delphian colony bearing
the tithe gift to the mother fane; for Apollo was founder
of cities. It was he who had first led the colonists to
their distant lands over the misty deep. Sculptors
came accompanying their statues; poets brought their
songs. Now would pass an Ionian gentleman in long
purple cloak, laughing, gesturing; now a quiet young
philosopher whose large-eyed vivid face showed his
spirit-quest. Philosophers were well known in Delphi
and more welcome than kings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span></p>

<p>How eagerly the visitors talked as they came along.
They had arrived after long journeying to within sight
of their goal. The broad Doric speech, the melodious
Attic, the barbarous dialects mixed with the speech of
Scyths, Sikels, and Gauls, all these she heard.</p>

<p>Among these passers-by were sure to be some who
would stop and enter Nikander’s door—guests of the
priestly house. Often these were men of high renown,
but quite as often they would be poor, in threadbare
garments, who had came to the Oracle in bitter need.
To these Nikander’s ministry was almost un-Greek in its
overflowing sympathy. An inherited skill of kindness
was his and his poet quality of insight was of no peculiar
race or date. Many a troubled wight came forth from
Nikander’s presence, serene to face the god.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In the centre of Nikander’s as in every Greek house
there was a fast-closed door. Behind this door lived the
women. They might, when only the family was in the
house, come through this door, but they had no business
or occupation on its outer side. At the appearance of
a guest the women must quickly disappear.</p>

<p>This door was at once Theria’s greatest grief and
greatest delight. Grief that it must constrain her at
all. Delight in that she could steal through it and
catch glimpses of her father’s guests. Often though she
was punished for this Theria always did it. Who would
not take punishment for a glimpse of Æschylus, Kimon,
Parmenides, or Pindar!</p>

<p>“Back to your room—quick, Daughter!” Nikander
would command whenever he noticed her. But often
Nikander would be absorbed in his guest, and the room
would be confused with serving-slaves. Nikander would
not even see Theria’s little figure crouched by a pillar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span></p>

<p>Of all the guests the Theban poet Pindar was the one
whom Theria loved best. Indeed all children loved
Pindar. Not a child in Delphi but would lift up eager
hands to that radiant smile as Pindar passed. There
was in him an almost aggressive joy. The same vitality
which makes a child leap and run and shout—all this
was in his adult nature. It shone out of the clear deeps
which were his eyes and trembled on his full Greek lips.
He seemed always just to have taken a deep breath as if
joying in the very air about him. His rather large
mouth and his nose both were well-built for breathing.
Splendour was his—splendour of imagination. His
whole being exulted in response to spiritual beauty unseen
by other men.</p>

<p>All Delphi adored him. They had a strangely spiritual
custom concerning him. Wherever Pindar might
be in bodily comings or goings, the keeper of the Apollo
temple when closing the shining doors at sunset hour
was wont to call aloud:</p>

<p>“Let Pindar, the poet, go in to the supper of the god!”</p>

<p>Theria was a very little girl when she first saw Pindar.
She was awakened by a sweet commotion of music, and
getting up from her bed she trotted down into the front
aula. The fateful door had been left open and she stole
through, a diminutive figure in her short chiton. She
went direct to Pindar.</p>

<p>The poet laid his lyre upon the table and lifted the
child to his knee.</p>

<p>“There, there; I awakened you, little one,” he said
tenderly.</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, “the music called me.”</p>

<p>“Called you, did it? And so you had to come?”</p>

<p>She did not answer but gazed up at him unwinking,
her tiny hands folding and unfolding in her utter joy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
at being so near to him. She was unaware of the others
sitting at the feast.</p>

<p>“Where do you get it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Get what? The lyre? Oh, of the lyre-maker in
Athens.”</p>

<p>She shook her curls.</p>

<p>“No, the song. Does it come out of the air?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps so, little one. Apollo gives it, surely.”</p>

<p>“Oh, will he give one to me?” she asked, her hands
clasping suddenly close to her breast. “If I make a
prayer to him and a sacrifice—a big, big sacrifice like
Father’s? A sheep, and burn it all up with leaping
flame till it smells so good—so good?”</p>

<p>Her baby nose sniffed deliciously and all the men
laughed.</p>

<p>“And where will you get your big sheep?” teased one.</p>

<p>“Nay, do not spoil her hope,” spoke Pindar quickly.
He drew the lyre toward her and instantly her chubby
hand reached out to touch the strings, sounding them
lovingly, softly.</p>

<p>Pindar watched her, absorbed.</p>

<p>“The god will give you your song, darling. Apollo’s
answer is already in your eyes and fingers.”</p>

<p>“Do you think so, Pindar?” asked Nikander, amused.
“Yet even so the child must not stop our feast. Medon,
will you carry her back to her nurse?”</p>

<p>Nikander expected that she would cry and struggle,
but she leaned over and kissed the lyre, then went
away with Medon, quite satisfied.</p>

<p>Ever from that time Theria awakened at the first
sound of Pindar’s lyre. She would steal down as near
as she dared. If the door were shut she would press
her ear against it in her eagerness to hear. If it were
open she would crouch in its shadow. The slaves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
passing to and fro with the feast never told. Theria
was a favourite with them.</p>

<p>It was Pindar’s habit to bring his songs to Nikander
when they were glowing new. Nikander, a poet who
had never written himself forth, had the keenest sense of
poetic values and Pindar was glad of his judgments.
Sometimes an ode would be sung again and again before
both pronounced it right. Then Pindar would go out
into the Delphic starlight humming the altered, perfected
refrain:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Harken, for once more we plough the field</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">of Aphrodite of the glancing eyes,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>or</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“In anywise to slake my thirst for song,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The ancient glory of thy forefathers summoneth me,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>or he would address his own songs, calling them</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“My lords of lute,</div>

  </div>
</div>

<p>These were the familiars of Theria’s childhood and
entered into the fabric of her mind. Pindar, as he strode
singing away, little recked of the girl-listener drinking
at his fountain and transmuted in all her being by his
supreme expression.</p>

<span class="smaller">WHAT GIFTS THE GUESTS BROUGHT</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">It was</span> through a guest that Theria first came to
visualize those distant colonies of the west which
gave so many gifts to Delphi and played so important
a part in Delphi’s life.</p>

<p>He was a simple-seeming guest, this young man from
far-away Elea in Italy. But child though Theria was,
she could not but note his face. It shone with an
almost startling quietness, a robust and heavenly
calm. The soul of the man had been dipped deep
and deep again in abstract thought. Earthly things
were washed away. The “Parmenidean Countenance
of Peace” was soon to be recognized throughout
Hellas, for even the disciples of Parmenides acquired
this same look.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, smiling, as though it were an ordinary
happening. “We were nearly shipwrecked off Corcyra.
Four days of storm. I thought my earthly term was
come. But I knew that I would at once rise from the
sea and begin my long progress toward the Eternal
Source.”</p>

<p>“Would you have been glad,” asked the amazed
Nikander, “to go on pilgrimage to Hades?”</p>

<p>“No—no,” laughed Parmenides. “Too much to do
here. Elea needs me. The city is now in my hands to
govern quite as I will. I govern by philosophy. And,
Nikander, we are happy in Elea! We are a little city<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
and on a far-away coast, yet even Athens has not our
justice and calm. Constantly I keep before the minds
of our citizens the importance of right, the unimportance
of this world’s goods. They know they are in
the hands of <em>The One</em>.”</p>

<p>“I could not worship <em>The One</em>,” said Nikander seriously.
“Think what a lonely god—an Only One, sitting
sole and wordless in Olympos with no other god to
speak to, to deal with, or to love. Or even to quarrel
with,” he added whimsically.</p>

<p>“But the gods themselves worship my god. They
know the One who is above them and controls.”</p>

<p>“Moira?” asked Nikander in a low voice. “Inexorable
Fate?”</p>

<p>“No, Nikander, not Fate, but Love—creating all
things—healing all things. Love—the First—the
Source.”</p>

<p>Parmenides’s eyes shone with eerie light. He was
fairly launched now. He began to recite his philosophy.
It was—as was all literary expression in those days—a
poem. Nikander listened entranced, laying it away
in his retentive Greek memory which would give him
back whole cantos of it almost entire.</p>

<p>Theria, crouched in the door corner wrapped in a
dark cloak, was content to listen to the rhythm. Of
the poem she understood not a word. Then she grew
weary of her stolen pleasure, but she dared not move
from her hiding place.</p>

<p>Presently Baltè began to call her through the house.</p>

<p>“Little mistress, little mistress, your mother asks for
you. Little mistress, she is ill and needs you.”</p>

<p>For, strange to say, in Melantho’s frequent headaches
it was Theria’s little magnetic hands which
helped most of all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span></p>

<p>“Apollo has blessed the child with his healing touch,”
old Baltè was wont to say.</p>

<p>But now Baltè called in vain, and at last, fearing that
her charge might be in forbidden quarters, she left off
her call.</p>

<p>But the interminable poem went on. It mingled at
last in Theria’s ears into a soft humming. Torches
were brought, and the evening meal. Priest and philosopher
lingered in ardent converse—that friction of
mind upon mind which the Greek men of that day so
loved and which with its sparkle and contagion of wit
made the Greek look with contempt upon the mere
written page.</p>

<p>Nikander, strolling dreamily to bed at midnight,
stumbled upon the heap wrapped in its dark cloak, and
lifted his daughter in his arms.</p>

<p>“Strange,” he murmured, “this continual disobedience.
What can draw her hither—I wonder?”</p>

<p>The childish face sleeping upon his arm reminded him
of his mother—a resemblance he had not noted before,
and very tenderly he carried her to her bed where Baltè
was waiting.</p>

<p>It was from a guest also that Theria heard the first
whisper of The War—that steadily approaching war
which was yet so far off that only the wise felt its dread.</p>

<p>Theria was older at this time and understood more
of what she heard.</p>

<p>Her father one day entered suddenly bringing with
him a stranger whose personality started her interest.
Unremitting energy! That was the keynote of the
man. He talked continually. Theria heard him even
before he entered—the clear voice of the orator. His
strange Attic dialect, his swift words made him a little
difficult for her to understand. Fair he was, tall, blue-eyed,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
strong, something un-Greek about him. Nikander
did not even see Theria this time. He was too absorbed
in Themistokles.</p>

<p>Their talk was first about the new play at Athens.
Themistokles had just heard the first great drama.
His heart was afire with the excitement of it.</p>

<p>“It is new, utterly new and powerful,” he exclaimed.
“Prometheus, it is called. Our Æschylus has outdone
himself. The very gods come down upon the stage.
And actors! We have never had such actors, Nikander.
But it is the greatness of the play which creates them—the
greatness of the play!”</p>

<p>“The lines!” pleaded Nikander. “Tell me the lines.”</p>

<p>And with ready memory Themistokles began. He
gestured swiftly with his hands. “Flashing hands,”
Theria named them. He puzzled her. Surely he was
not Athenian—not quite moderate and serene—and his
cloak with its border of purple and gold was a little too
conspicuous of beauty.</p>

<p>In the midst of a scene he broke off.</p>

<p>“But here we talk of the play,” he said. “When I
want to talk of dear Athens. Nikander, the Athenians
are blind, every one of them, <em>blind</em>!”</p>

<p>“Gracious,” laughed Nikander, “no one else thinks
so.”</p>

<p>“They will not believe that the Persian will come
again. ‘Oh,’ they boast, ‘We conquered them at Marathon,
that deed is done.’ But the deed is not done.
Nikander, <em>you</em> know the Persian will return. Ye of
Delphi, are you so unaware?”</p>

<p>He seized Nikander’s hand and Nikander sobered
instantly.</p>

<p>“Indeed we are not unaware,” he answered.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nikander, the trophies of Miltiades will not let<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
me rest. Such trophies must be won again. May the
gods let me win them!”</p>

<p>Nikander did not reply but Theria saw him search the
man’s face, as if anxiously measuring him for some great
need.</p>

<p>“Have you news, Themistokles—fresh news?”</p>

<p>“No, only straws, but plenty of them. I keep a
clever slave down at the Piræus who has no other business
than to listen to stories of the ship-merchants and
traders. Sailors know the way of the winds—the winds
of the future. They push in at every shore. The
Great King they tell us is now warring against Egypt,
but our turn is next. Oh, it is surely the next. Nikander,
the armies which Darius brought against us seven
years agone were but a handful to those which his son
Xerxes will bring.”</p>

<p>“I believe that,” said Nikander. “Ay, and the
Delphian Council believe it, too.”</p>

<p>“Good!” exclaimed the Athenian.</p>

<p>“It is not good. Do you know, Themistokles, what
this belief breeds in the Council? Fear; only fear!
‘Hellas cannot withstand the Persian.’ That is what
they are whispering here in Delphi. ‘Hellas is
doomed.’”</p>

<p>Themistokles’s face took on a horror which startled
the listening girl.</p>

<p>“Nikander,” he cried, “you will not allow Delphi to
shirk. The Oracle must stand by Athens!”</p>

<p>“I will stand by Athens and by all Hellas,” said
Nikander solemnly. “I believe Apollo will defend his
own.”</p>

<p>Themistokles now began to talk of the silver mines
of Laurium and how he had been trying to persuade the
Athenians to forego their yearly gift of silver in order to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
build ships for fighting against the little island of
Ægina.</p>

<p>“Will so many ships be needed?” queried Nikander
with sharp insight.</p>

<p>Themistokles leaned toward him, laughing softly,
triumphantly. “For the war with Ægina!” he said, low-toned.
“Believe me, for that war the ships will not be
used. But when the Persian comes, he will find certain
ships in our harbour that will give him pause. Remember
that, Nikander, so that you may give credit to
Themistokles who saw before the event.”</p>

<p>All too soon Themistokles took his departure. Afterward
Theria heard the slaves gossiping about the man.
“He brought with him a purple tent,” they said, “and
furniture and many slaves, even for his short visit.”
Themistokles lived like a prince in Delphi.</p>

<span class="smaller">DRYAS TAKES A ROBBER</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">There</span> was no use mincing matters; Lycophron,
the eldest son of Nikander, was not satisfactory.
Handsome in person, he had nevertheless always
been slow to learn and swift in evil doing, the
bane of his Delphic schoolmasters. At fourteen years
his features had coarsened, his eyes grown less intelligent.
Now at eighteen that phase was past and he
was clever in a fashion which Nikander vainly tried to
think creditable. Nikander wanted to keep close to his
boy in study and sports. Lycophron was his first-born.
Some day Lycophron would be priest in Nikander’s
stead, would take his chair in the Amphictyonic Council.
Yet try as he might, Nikander could never look
forward to this succession without shame.</p>

<p>Lycophron now began to demand money for horses
and a chariot for the Olympian games. Nikander
could ill afford so expensive a winning. He had hoped
that his eldest son would win the crown for leaping or
running, some act which would be reflected back in
manly beauty and strength. Yet Nikander managed
to give Lycophron money for his horses. He loved his
eldest with a sensitive, intimate love.</p>

<p>But now came Dryas. Dryas from the first week of
school had shown himself a promising son of the ancient
house, and Nikander’s joy in him was beautiful to see.
Always when Dryas returned from school Nikander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
would contrive to be in the aula to greet him, to
hear the latest Doric melody the boy had learned, to
correct the faults, or recite with him the passage of
Homer which had been the lesson of the day.</p>

<p>Sometimes Nikander would linger along the road,
meet Dryas, and, dismissing the pedagogue, would
himself conduct the boy home.</p>

<p>Dryas was not always strong. Nikander summoned
for him the best physicians from Athens and on his ill
days would sit beside him patiently trying to ease the
child. At such times Theria helped, knowing by that
curious instinct of hers what to do. And when the pain
was eased, Dryas would draw her face down and kiss
her. Nikander was almost jealous of the love that
Dryas gave to his twin sister. As he grew taller,
however, Dryas grew also well and strong.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>One winter evening Dryas and his slave boy were returning
from the gymnasium, old Medon his pedagogue
being lame and at home. All afternoon Dryas had been
exercising. Then in the gymnasium he had stood under
the pouring fountain, a chilly bath, and the slave boy
had rubbed him to a glow. He was full of life and of a
sense of waxing strength. Dreams of Olympian contests
were in his heart as they were in the heart of every
boy of Greece.</p>

<p>“Come,” said he to the slave. “Let’s go out the eastern
road. You have the bow. Maybe we’ll bring down
a hare.”</p>

<p>“It will grow dark soon,” ventured the slave. “And
your father will be coming to meet you.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be dark,” answered Dryas. “Come, I
say.”</p>

<p>So together they walked eastward on the hill road.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
They passed the row of outer temples and the hillside
tombs. Sure enough, against all hope, a hare leaped
across the road. Dryas shot it, and the slave fetched
and slung it over his shoulder. Then they started back
to town.</p>

<p>Twilight had fallen when they repassed the graves.
The boys shrank close to each other. Both slave and
free were afraid of the spirits which hovered there.</p>

<p>As they came to the roadside temples they saw a man
dart quickly around a corner.</p>

<p>“What was that?” asked Dryas sharply.</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” answered the slave. Dryas, with
wide eyes of fear, backed behind a rock.</p>

<p>“If he’s stealing from the gods we ought to stop him,”
spoke the slave. “See; we have our bow.”</p>

<p>At this word Dryas, ashamed of his fear, came out
from hiding.</p>

<p>“Stay by me,” he pleaded, and the slave advanced
first.</p>

<p>These small temples, being outside the Precinct wall,
were poorly guarded. The boys crept nearer and
rounded the corner just in time to see the man with
some silver cups in his arms running down the hill.</p>

<p>The boys gave chase. The man circled around so as
to come up the hill again. The upper heights were always
a fastness for robbers. The boys still followed,
and above the road overtook the man.</p>

<p>Dryas with a cry half like a sob leaped upon him while
the slave at the same time tripped his heels. The fellow
went down like a log, screaming in panic. The boys
quickly possessed themselves of the cups. The slave
with his own leather belt tied the man’s hands, and together
the boys pulled the man down the road—he not
resisting at all. They pushed him along toward town.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span></p>

<p>At the edge of the village Nikander met them. In all
his life Nikander never forgot that shock—first the
fear, then the joy—as he realized that Dryas, spite of
bleeding face and dishevelled hair, was safe and that he
had done a brave deed.</p>

<p>“Father, it is a robber,” Dryas was saying excitedly.
“I caught him by the outer temples. See, he had the
silver temple cups.”</p>

<p>“My son,” said Nikander. “My son!”</p>

<p>At sound of Nikander’s voice the man fell down again,
howling like an animal in fear. And strangely, Dryas,
too, broke into hysterical weeping.</p>

<p>“Don’t let them kill him, Father. Don’t let them kill
the man!”</p>

<p>“But he has committed sacrilege.”</p>

<p>“Oh, no—no, if they kill him I’ll die, too. Oh, I’m
afraid! Oh, he would haunt me.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense, Dryas.”</p>

<p>Here the man tried to get upon his feet but tumbled
down again.</p>

<p>“Pitiful Hermes!” cried Nikander. “The wretch is
starving.”</p>

<p>Dryas, still sobbing, caught nervously at the man’s
bonds and pulled them off.</p>

<p>“Here, Son,” said Nikander. “Give him a drachma.”</p>

<p>The poor creature snatched the money and seeing
the look of relenting in Nikander’s face, sprang up the
hill with sudden life. He was quickly lost among the
crags.</p>

<p>The incident soon got abroad in Delphi. The boys
at school made a hero of Dryas. They had always
liked him.</p>

<p>Nikander, however, could not help recurring to
Dryas’s curious, passionate weeping. He told himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
that it was natural. The young boy should be pitiful.
But the weeping had not seemed to be pity. Something
selfish, almost craven was in it. And a look in the slave
boy’s face made Nikander think that the slave had done
as much or more of the deed than Dryas himself.</p>

<p>Nikander pushed these thoughts from him and when
Dryas’s praise came in from every side, Nikander gladly
forgot them.</p>

<p>For from this time the Delphians began to take notice
of Nikander’s younger son. His beauty was growing
every day. He had a voice high, clear, unearthly
sometimes, and he played the lyre with firm touch while
he sang. He was only fourteen years old.</p>

<p>One day, as the priests broke up their council after the
giving of the Oracle, the old Akeratus, president of the
priests, detained Nikander. He told him that his boy
Dryas had been chosen the “Laurel-Bearer” for the
next Strepterion feast. It was the greatest honour
the Delphians could give to a young Delphian boy.
Then Nikander went home feeling that his cup of joy
was full.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smaller">LAUREL FROM TEMPÈ</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Theria’s</span> joy, too, was full. The tie between
Dryas and herself was very strong and his happiness
closely touched her.</p>

<p>But, oh, the further marvel! Theria was to go up to
the Precinct to see the sacred rite. She was older now.
Had she not already dedicated her girlhood toys to
Artemis? Soon she would be a woman and for women
there were certain rare occasions when they might
visit the temple place.</p>

<p>The new white himation which she was to wear she
hung on a peg in her room. Gazing at this, fingering it,
she could almost realize she was about to go to the
Precinct. The joy caught strongly at her throat.
Every day she begged her mother to name over each
temple that she was to see, each treasury, each statue
that flanked the Sacred Way until Melantho clapped
hands over her ears and ordered her out of the room.</p>

<p>Theria never moved quietly about the house. She
always ran or skipped. Now as she ran, she sang aloud
or, leaping into her swing in the court, she swept upward
like a swallow, until she could see high over the balcony
into the second-story rooms. The whole house felt the
contagion of her joy.</p>

<p>“I’m to attend little mistress,” boasted Nerea in the
kitchen. “By Hermes, the best o’ the festival will be
to see her face goin’ into the gates.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span></p>

<p>The Strepterion was a festival which like the Pythia
came every fourth year. At the Strepterion was performed
the sacred drama, “Apollo Killing the Python,”
the very same which Dryas had acted in play when a
baby, and now he was to act it in earnest.</p>

<p>Midway in the Precinct was built a temporary hut
called the Palace of the Snake. And the snake would be
there, a marvel of contrivance, his ugly dragon head,
with open mouth and teeth, resting on the threshold.
Dryas, arrayed as the boy Apollo, must in mimic
dance and gesture fight the dragon. A chorus of boys
carrying torches would sing the story. Then after the
struggle Apollo must lift his silver bow and shoot the
dragon. It would die with great writhings and agony—a
joy to the crowd.</p>

<p>Presently all the actors would come in solemn, silent
procession down the Sacred Way. They would pass
out of the gate of the Precinct, through the village, and
away on the western road.</p>

<p>Thus would begin a long journey which would take
from moon to moon. Symbolically, the actors would
journey to the land of the Hyperboreans beyond the
north wind. Actually they would trace an ancient way
of pilgrimage, the Pythian Way, to the Vale of Tempè.</p>

<p>At Tempè Dryas, as the Sacred Boy, would gather
boughs from a certain famous laurel tree, and bring
them home to be woven into crowns for the Pythian
victors. For the Pythian festival and games always
fell in the same year, a few weeks later than the
Strepterion.</p>

<p>All this was to be Dryas’s adventure. He would
return to tell of its wonders. He was a dear, companionable
boy. Theria knew he would tell her the
whole of it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span></p>

<p>On the morning of Strepterion she awoke before
daybreak and lay in that ecstasy of anticipation which
only youth-time knows. Presently dawned the light
and showed her her white dress, still hanging ghostly
on its peg. She arose and went out into the court-balcony.
Here she met Dryas. He, too, had awakened
early with the joy of the day.</p>

<p>“Good luck,” she greeted him. “The luck of
Loxias.” And he answered piously, “Apollo bless you.”</p>

<p>Between them they roused the whole family.</p>

<p>At sunrise Dryas must be clothed in his ceremonial
robes. He stood in the court near the Hestia hearth
where all the family could see him, where the slaves
could gather proudly to look on. They brought
forth the temple himation, yellow with its border of
gold, an ancient, precious thing.</p>

<p>Dreamily, sensitively, Dryas suffered them to put it
on him, to unplait his long hair that it might flow over
his shoulders in the manner of Apollo. Already he
felt upon him the sacred character of the god he was to
personate.</p>

<p>Nikander advanced to place the golden laurel crown
on Dryas’s head. He came slowly, unlike himself, and
in the ceremony spoke only the necessary words—no
more. He made sacrifice upon the hearth and then,
stumbling a little, stepped back.</p>

<p>It was time to go. The whole family were to walk
behind Dryas up to the Precinct. Theria stood hand
in hand with her mother. Her eyes were like stars.</p>

<p>“Son,” said Nikander in a low voice, “I cannot go
with you now. I will come up in a few moments with
Medon. The priests will meet you at the gate.”</p>

<p>“Father—but why?” A troubled look crossed the
boy’s rapt face.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span></p>

<p>“I am not quite well. Just for a moment. I’ll be
with you soon, my son.”</p>

<p>Theria darted out and touched his hand.</p>

<p>“Never mind, Daughter,” he said. “Make haste, all
of you.”</p>

<p>Obediently the family formed in a sort of procession
and left the house.</p>

<p>Oh, the golden sunshine of that early morning! The
sweet cool air with the blessing of the stars still upon it!
Theria took thirsty draughts of it as she went along.</p>

<p>The cliffs towered nobly about as if in prayer and
along their face the mists, white spirits new risen from
the vale, came shouldering, sinking, lifting, dreamily
alive. So tall are the cliffs at Delphi that they meet the
blue and cut off from sight the snowy peak of Parnassos
which is back above them.</p>

<p>Now the procession turned the shoulder of a cliff.
The Precinct burst into view—the Precinct, a golden
and many-hued Elysium lying on the slope above the
road within its quadrate wall.</p>

<p>It slanted against the hillside in the sunshine.
Theria could see the bright little fanes, the golden
tripods, the zig-zag of the Sacred Way dividing it in the
midst, and the great Apollo temple at the top. The
Precinct seemed to spread itself generously before her
sight—all of it at once—as though knowing how
dearly she loved it.</p>

<p>Above the Precinct were the cliffs again soaring
terribly to the sky.</p>

<p>Now the procession was stopping. It was before
the great bronze doors. The doors were opening,
showing a glimpse of the wonder place within. Here
a company of priests, with the old president or Hosios,
received them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span></p>

<p>They greeted Dryas. Then—</p>

<p>“But where is Nikander?” they asked.</p>

<p>“He said he would join us,” answered Dryas. “He
should be with us by now.”</p>

<p>“We will wait for him,” said the old Hosios.</p>

<p>And so they waited. Moments—a half hour and
still Nikander did not arrive. The priests began to stir
impatiently. Dryas looked around with anxious eyes.</p>

<p>Theria slipped back among the slaves.</p>

<p>“Baltè,” she said, “he does not come!”</p>

<p>“Hist, little mistress, we must not speak in this
place.”</p>

<p>“But, Baltè, perhaps he is ill.”</p>

<p>“Medon is there, and Philo.”</p>

<p>Theria suddenly recalled that her father’s hand
when she touched it had been cold as ice. How
curiously he had stumbled as he turned from the crowning—an
ill omen that. Theria had a sure instinct
concerning illness. She knew that her father was in
trouble. All the joy of the festival and of the out of
doors folded its wings in her heart. She could think
only of her father.</p>

<p>Now she was dimly aware that the old Hosios had let
open the gates and bade Dryas enter. She caught
Baltè’s hand.</p>

<p>“I’m going back home,” she said. “Baltè, come
quickly.”</p>

<p>“But, little mistress, what a crazy notion is this?”</p>

<p>“I’ll be back for the festival. Oh, I’ll be back in
time. But I must meet Father.”</p>

<p>“But, little mistress——”</p>

<p>“Baltè, come at once!”</p>

<p>And Baltè, who never before had obeyed her little
girl, came without a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span></p>

<p>They hurried back along the road. Nikander did
not meet them on the way. Theria was the more
terrified. Entering the house she heard music—the
music of the physician. She ran to her father’s room.</p>

<p>He lay gasping upon the bed, his fine face drawn like
an old, old man’s. His eyes, haunted with pain,
turned toward Theria, but he did not speak; perhaps
he could not. The physician in the corner sang
nervously the healing ode of Apollo. Medon was
clasping his hands.</p>

<p>“Oh, Missy, Missy,” he moaned. “The doctor gave
the medicine and it did no good. Now he’s playin’ the
music. When he does that—it’s the end—the end!”</p>

<p>The room was suffocating.</p>

<p>“Air,” thought Theria. “Father must have air.”</p>

<p>She stamped her foot at the physician. “Stop that
wailing!” she commanded. “Stop it at once.”</p>

<p>The physician was glad enough to obey her. If
Nikander died it could be the daughter’s fault.</p>

<p>Then swiftly, businesslike, Theria had them carry
her father, bed and all, into the street and sent Baltè for
hot water which she applied. She was trembling in
very childishness of grief. Sometimes she flung herself
upon her father, kissing him, begging him to live.
But nevertheless she kept on with her simple remedies—remedies
she had used before.</p>

<p>At last, so gradually that she could not tell when it
began, the pain abated. Nikander’s eyes grew clear
and his breath came even once more.</p>

<p>“Daughter!” he spoke at last. “My darling girl.”</p>

<p>And Baltè, putting down the steaming pot of water,
gave a shout of joy.</p>

<p>Meanwhile up in the Precinct the festival was going
forward, but Theria had forgotten it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span></p>

<p>At length Nikander was strong enough to be carried
back into the aula where he fell asleep. Then it was
that Theria heard the sound of pipes and shouting
in the street. Instinctively she ran upstairs to the
window.</p>

<p>The sacred drama was over. Here came the actors—now
a happy, laughing rout. It was the custom that
the Tempè procession leave the city in haste so as to
out-distance all evil. First Dryas came running in the
beautiful leaps which Greek racers used. His hair
was streaming in the wind. He held aloft his silver
bow in triumph and great joy. Then came the swift
boy chorus with backward burning torches and beauty
of fluttering garments, then the sacred women having
an awkward time of it to keep the boys in sight. And
the crowd laughing at them and shouting:</p>

<p>“Good luck for the journey. The luck of Loxias.”</p>

<p>So shouting, laughing, the picture of joyous life, they
disappeared down the road.</p>

<p>Ah, there was the last gleam of Dryas’s silver bow!</p>

<p>“At least,” thought Theria, “when Dryas comes
back, he will have Father to greet him instead of—instead——”</p>

<p>Then with tender happiness—or was it the bitterness
of missing her one festival—she hid her face, weeping.</p>

<span class="smaller">A BOY CALLED SOPHOCLES</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">One</span> hot summer morning Melantho and her
daughter were sitting in the upper room spinning.
Or rather it was Melantho who was
<em>sitting</em>. Theria was pacing to and fro at her task,
stretching out the thread with free gesture, her fingers
twisting, twisting like fluttering wings. Melantho
noted how tall the girl had grown. “Her awkwardness,
too, is passing,” she mused as Theria turned,
sweeping the thin folds of her chiton against her supple
limbs. So might Iris have looked, the slender goddess
messenger, running to the divine threshold with news
for the blessed gods.</p>

<p>But Melantho had no thought of goddesses.</p>

<p>“She will soon be old enough for a husband,” was
Melantho’s thought. “I must speak to Nikander
about it.”</p>

<p>Theria sighed and paced again.</p>

<p>“Theria,” said her mother, “if you would sit down
you would not be so tired.”</p>

<p>“Tired,” spoke the girl, frowning, “Great Hermes,
why should I be tired except from this eternal sitting?
There’s no breath in this room.”</p>

<p>“Theria, you grow more impatient every day. Do
you suppose your father can ever get you a husband if
you frown like that?”</p>

<p>At the word “husband,” the girl gave her mother a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span>
startled, puzzled look. She said nothing. Melantho’s
thoughts ran in given channels. Her next was of
vegetables and fish which Medon must purchase this
morning.</p>

<p>“Daughter,” she said, “go down and fetch Medon to
me.”</p>

<p>Quick as thought, Theria dropped her spindle into
the basket of snowy wool and sped away.</p>

<p>The morning was full of sunshine. Theria carolled
like a lark as she tripped down the stair. Housed
though she was, Theria never seemed housed. Perhaps
the effect upon generation after generation of her
forefathers of living out of doors, the strengthening,
sweetening effect upon mind and body, had entered into
her and made her part of the open air.</p>

<p>Through the inner court she ran and burst open the
door into the outer court of the men. Here pure
amazement stopped her motion. In the outer court
stood the most beautiful boy Theria had ever beheld.</p>

<p>He had laid aside his himation for the heat, and stood
in his short chiton, slender, delicately erect, gazing
about his new surroundings with shy yet interested
eyes. His hair, honey coloured, was cut short and
filleted as if for a holiday. He himself was bronzed
by the sun as all high-born boys should be. At sight
of Theria he smiled.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, lady,” he said. “My father left me here
to wait for him.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” said Theria, “I thought perhaps a god had
done that.” At which speech he blushed, and became
a little lovelier.</p>

<p>She came toward him. She was not shy, for the boy
was younger than she. Besides, she was too delighted
with his beauty to be shy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span></p>

<p>“Whence are you?” she queried.</p>

<p>“From Colonos.”</p>

<p>“The grove near Athens?”</p>

<p>“Yes, the shady, sacred grove. The most beautiful
place in the world.”</p>

<p>“More beautiful than Delphi?” she smiled.</p>

<p>“I think so, lady.”</p>

<p>“It is your home,” said Theria gently. “Therefore
you love it.”</p>

<p>“My father came to consult the Oracle,” explained the
boy. “He questions about his ship which comes not
back to us. He is now with your father in the Precinct.
For you are Nikander’s daughter, are you not?”</p>

<p>“Yes—his only daughter,” she answered with pride.</p>

<p>How modestly the boy questioned. His respect
toward her was something new in Theria’s experience.
Both her brothers were brotherly contemptuous. But
this stranger was talking with her! To Theria this
experience was nothing short of an adventure. She
felt it so. Mind and soul sprang up vivid and intense.
She began to ask her usual eager questions.</p>

<p>“How did you come to Delphi? Was it a long
journey? Oh, was it by sea?”</p>

<p>“No, lady, by land—through Bœotia and over the
mountains.”</p>

<p>“How many days?”</p>

<p>“Three days—we did not hurry. Yesterday at sunset
we came to the Triple Way.”</p>

<p>“Where Œdipus met his father.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he answered, “where he killed his father.
Of course you know the story. Oh, lady, such a
lovely place it is. Up there where the mountains
pierce the sky; the road runs among the clouds. Where
the clouds broke I could catch glimpses far beneath of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
the blue valley and the sun setting. Far down I
heard the tinkle of goat bells—the herds hidden below
the clouds. I seemed to be in the home of the gods.
And do you know what I did? I let the others walk
onward and I stood there alone. The three roads
went this way and that from the place of my feet.
Then I seemed to see approaching along one road old
Laius and his men, and by the other road Œdipus,
young and proud, fulfilling his curse. But before they
met I fled. Oh, I could not bear to think that he would
kill his father all unknowing! What if it had been
my own dear father and myself? The curse of Œdipus,
that terrible curse, swept down over me with whirlwind
wings.”</p>

<p>The boy put up his hand to his head with a whimsical
yet solemn smile.</p>

<p>“It touched me,” he said, “and when I ran up to my
dear father and clasped his hand I was weeping. I
would not tell them why. Yet I am telling <em>you</em>.”</p>

<p>“I wish I had been there,” breathed Theria.</p>

<p>“I wish you had,” echoed the boy.</p>

<p>And suddenly the boy’s gentle reverence gave Theria
a joy utterly new—a sense at once of humbleness and
power.</p>

<p>“Come,” she said childishly, seizing his hand, “there’s
a swing in the other aula. Let’s swing in it.” Busily
she hied him thither. But the boy would not swing.</p>

<p>“It’s for girls; I’ll push you,” he said.</p>

<p>Soon the court rang with their voices and merry
laughter. The boy “ran under” and Theria flew like a
tall nymph in great dips and soarings. Now her black
tresses streamed behind, new they flung over her face—a
dusky veil. After a while the boy stopped, breathless,
and the swing “died.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span></p>

<p>“Guess who came with us all the way,” he said
suddenly.</p>

<p>“I cannot guess.”</p>

<p>“Pindar!” he told her joyously. “That’s what made
the journey so wonderful. All those three days I
heard his divine talk with my father. Never shall I
forget it—all about Hellas and the Persians and the war
that is coming. I hope it won’t come too soon before
I can fight.”</p>

<p>“Pindar is ours,” said Theria with Delphic pride.
“There is a chair set in the temple just for him. He sits
there and the god gives him song. Tell me: did you
hear him sing?”</p>

<p>“Often and often,” boasted the boy. “When we
would stop by the road to sup and pour wine to the
blessed gods, then a slave would bring Pindar’s lyre.
A fine old one it is, always fresh stringed. He would
sweep it with his hand and the thing would tremble as if
alive. Do you think my hand is like Pindar’s?” he
asked, stretching out his right hand. Slender and
brown it was, expressive as his face.</p>

<p>“No,” said the girl honestly, “but it is a player’s
hand.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to be a poet some day,” ran on the boy.</p>

<p>“I wish I might be a poet,” said Theria.</p>

<p>“You! But you are a girl. For you will be the
house and children and the loom.”</p>

<p>“I hate the house!” cried Theria.</p>

<p>“What! The home of your fathers? How can
you?” The boy was shocked.</p>

<p>“Oh, I don’t mean the home. I mean the house walls
that keep me in. Sometimes I want to scream and
struggle as though I were tied down hand and foot.”</p>

<p>“But nothing ties you down.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span></p>

<p>“Do you call it nothing to stay all day twisting a
miserable thread like this?” Theria spun with her
fingers. “When there is so much, oh, so much in the
world.”</p>

<p>“But do women feel that way?” he asked. “They
always seem contented in the house.”</p>

<p>“Would you be content?”</p>

<p>“By the gods, no.”</p>

<p>“But are we not like you, we girls? We are strong—we
like to run and breathe the air. Look at my arm,
how ugly white. It has never seen the sun.” She
flashed out her fair arm—free of its drapery.</p>

<p>“That is not ugly,” said the boy gently.</p>

<p>“It is! It is! White as a Persian’s!”</p>

<p>“No, it is Greek,” maintained the boy. “By the
gods, I’d like to see you running brown and free like
Artemis in the wood.”</p>

<p>“You don’t think I am foolish to want to run and
leap.”</p>

<p>“No—no—no!”</p>

<p>Theria’s eyes widened with delight.</p>

<p>“You don’t think me foolish to read my father’s
books?”</p>

<p>“Books!” Here the boy was puzzled. “Why should
you read books? Poems are to sing, not to read.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I sing them, too,” laughed Theria. “Far back
in the storeroom, when nobody can hear, I sing them.
I have to make up the tunes.”</p>

<p>“I wish I could hear you; oh, I wish I could hear
you.”</p>

<p>That any one should care for what she did! No
praise could be sweeter, no joy. So absorbed were they
both that they did not hear the voices calling through
the house, “Sophocles! Sophocles!” until the searchers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
had entered the open door—that door which should
always be closed.</p>

<p>“Eleutheria,” came her father’s voice, sterner than
she had ever heard it. “The meaning of this! By
Hermes, I must know.”</p>

<p>The two turned in confusion.</p>

<p>“Whatever made you think you could bring a stranger
here into the inner court? How long have you been
together?”</p>

<p>Theria answered none of his questions. She faced
him, her eyes black lakes of astonishment. So intense
a mood could not break at once.</p>

<p>“I have done no wrong,” she asserted. “How can
you think I have done wrong?”</p>

<p>“But you have. You are almost a woman. You
cannot receive my guests.”</p>

<p>“<em>My</em> guest he is, this Sophocles,” she answered with
frightened face but steady voice. “We have been
talking together about Homer and Pindar. Surely
that is no harm. Where is our wrong?”</p>

<p>A low exclamation came from the corner of the room.
Pindar himself was there with Sophocles’s father.</p>

<p>The boy spoke, blushing, “I am the one to blame.
I came in here to push the swing—not thinking.”</p>

<p>“There is no blame,” repeated the girl passionately.
“Don’t call it blame.”</p>

<p>Had Nikander been an ordinary Greek father,
Theria would undoubtedly have received her whipping
at this time.</p>

<p>“Go to your room, Daughter,” said Nikander
quietly. “I cannot talk with you here.”</p>

<p>And Theria fled in an agony of shame.</p>

<p>Pindar’s voice broke the silence.</p>

<p>“By the deep-vested Graces, Nikander, but I think<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span>
we have broken into a pretty dialogue. Would I had
heard some of it.”</p>

<p>The boy, redder still, hid behind his father.</p>

<p>Nikander shook his head in whimsical despair.</p>

<p>“What am I to do with a daughter like that? I
never know what she will do next. She’s perfectly
good, I assure you. She only breaks rules like a colt.”</p>

<p>“She’s your image,” laughed Pindar. “Your own
face faced you when she spoke. Ay, and your spirit, too.
By Artemis, did you mark how she fled up the stairs
with head held high?”</p>

<p>“She’s a twin, you know,” said Nikander. “The
boy is more beautiful.”</p>

<p>“Ay, I know your Dryas. The coming beauty
they say, and perhaps the coming singer.”</p>

<p>Nikander’s face flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>“The lyrists tell me so,” he assented.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus Eros brushed his wings across Theria’s fancy
and flew away. No business of his was this. But
youth was here—fearful impressibility: A breath, and
youth is changed.</p>

<p>Who shall say that when in after years this boy sang
of a woman and gave her a new type of nobleness
the image of this proud sweet maid of Delphi did not
float before him and make his creation real?</p>

<p>And as for Theria, the encounter was a peep outward
into the world. From this time she became more
aware of the hurry of development outside in the
awakening land of Greece. From this time she felt
it—the joyous advance into the light, new art, new
politics, new thoughts.</p>

<p>The amassing knowledge of centuries was converging<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
to a focus and the heart of the Greeks soared into
a mental atmosphere never known before or since.
This intense point came in Theria’s lifetime. No
wonder the light of it penetrated all her walls and restrictions.
No wonder she struggled to be free to meet
it. Her own youth was of the youth-time of Hellas
and longed to be merged with it as flame yearns toward
flame.</p>

<span class="smaller">WHY NOT BE THE PYTHIA?</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">In times</span> of war we picture every corner of a warring
land torn with passion, dark with fear, dyed
with blood. But this is not so. In Nikander’s
household the four meals a day were served by quiet
slaves, the washing was done down in the Pleistos
River as the good housewife Melantho required it.
Eleutheria received her daily lesson in spinning and
weaving and damaged more good wool than any maid
of all the generations of Nikanders. This indeed was
Dame Melantho’s chief grief, despite the fact that her
little land was cowering under the heaviest cloud of
war that ever threatened a devoted country.</p>

<p>At every festival came crowding news of the great
Persian king across the sea preparing his army to
invade and devour. Into every port came sailors telling
of the fleets of Phœnicians, Cyprians, Lykians,
Dorians of Asia, etc., all of which fleets were making
ready to pounce upon Greece. Then arrived the actual
ambassadors of the King, demanding earth and water.
Which was to say: “Consent to slavery and the Persians
will leave you out of the fight.” Many cities
gave these tokens immediately.</p>

<p>“Who, then, will resist?” “What will happen if any
should resist?” “Will the gods help?” “Have the
gods forgotten their beloved Hellas?”</p>

<p>Such were the questions which poured into Delphi.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span>
These days Nikander might be seen pacing to and fro
in some lesche or near the Council House, seeing naught
before him, blind to the beauty of hills and far-glimpsed
vale. Then perhaps in desperation he would stride
down the hill and along the road toward home.</p>

<p>In the women’s aula Melantho would greet him with
the small worries of the day. A slave child was ill and
she knew not what to do for it. She must have more
grain to store away in the storeroom or Nikander
would have to go without his special cake next winter.</p>

<p>“And will you have a cake now?” she asked. “And a
little wine? Do, now; you look tired.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said. “Yes.”</p>

<p>And so she went out to make the slaves do all in
order.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Theria came in and sat upon a stool near
by. She spoke no word but tried to untangle a thread
from her distaff, parting wisp from wisp with slender
fingers, and watched her father with keen, quiet eyes.
Melantho returned chattering and Nikander ate his
cake in silence, and still Theria watched.</p>

<p>She knew that the Amphictyonic Council, that famous
council of many states, was meeting to-day in its
house west of the town. Why was it meeting now?
This was not the season. She knew that her father
had been with it. He was one of the Amphictyons.
There had been hot dispute, she could see that in his
face. But had he won? And what was the strife
about? She knew something of the danger which
threatened the land. This she knew in spite of the
fact that Nikander had been strict in keeping the news
away from the household. He hated the aspects of
fear: these would come soon enough.</p>

<p>Bitterly Theria longed to ask questions. She knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
that there was no use. She knew that her father had
come home for peace, for a respite.</p>

<p>After a while Melantho was called away, and Theria
moved over beside her father on the bench and slipped
her hand into his. He sighed restfully as she did so.
Then care again settled like closing wings upon him.
Theria decided that he had not won in the Council—at
least not for to-day. She also decided that the controversy
had been serious. She could not guess that it
had to do with the whole policy of the Oracle in the
face of the Persian attack. In that Council Nikander
and one friend stood alone for the defence of Greece.
All the others stood for surrender.</p>

<p>Theria’s first instinct was the woman’s, to mend her
father’s disappointment by some diversion.</p>

<p>“Father,” she said, “I have been thinking all day of
the birds that Homer tells of on the Scamandrian
plain.”</p>

<p>He frowned and came out of his dream. “What is
Homer to you, child?” he said impatiently.</p>

<p>“Nothing, Father; but I often think of those things.
I love the birds,” she added quietly. “They are so
merry and move so swift, so swift. They are kind,
too.”</p>

<p>“Kind! What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“They come to me when I go to the window—oh, just
a few moments at the window, Father, to breathe the
air. Then I call them their own calls and they fly
down out of the air, very timid at first. I put out my
hand and hold it still and talk to them. Finally, one of
them is sure to flutter near and sit on my finger with
its little sharp claws. They watch me with clever
quick turnings of the head and chirp to make me laugh.”</p>

<p>She leaned forward—very child in this childish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
pleasure. “Father, tell me what Homer says about the
birds.”</p>

<p>“I am in no mood for Homer’s lines.” And indeed
he was not. But presently he began to say them—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“As the many tribes of feathered birds,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Wild geese and long-necked swans</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the Asian mead by Kystrios stream</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Fly hither and thither joying in their plumage</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And with loud cries settle ever onward——”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“What a picture!” he commented. “I never realized
before how fine it is.”</p>

<p>Did his nearness to the ardent Theria bring this realization?
Who can tell how mind may leap toward mind?</p>

<p>So they were sitting when Olen, the slave boy, came
and stood beside them.</p>

<p>“Master, a consultant,” he announced, “at the street
door. He will not come in.”</p>

<p>Nikander rose from the bench, strangely refreshed,
and went to the outer aula. As Olen was following,
Theria made him an imperious gesture and the slave
reluctantly left ajar the dividing door. Then Theria
moved to sit where she could command the outer room.</p>

<p>She saw enter a man with white, wrecked face.</p>

<p>“But I must not come in,” he objected. “O priest,
I might bring it upon your house.”</p>

<p>“My house is not afraid,” said Nikander. He sat
down, indicating the bench beside him, and the man sat
down fearfully, like one unclean, at the farther end.</p>

<p>“It is a curse, O priest,” he said. “I am under a
curse.”</p>

<p>Very skilfully Nikander quieted him, urging upon
him kindness and wisdom of the Oracle, persuading
him to speak. It was a terrible tale of this man<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
Corobios and his friend Pythias—one of those Greek
friendships so seriously considered that marriage was
not allowed between the children of the two.</p>

<p>“We were on a journey,” said Corobios. “Five
robbers leaped from ambush upon Pythias. It was him
they were after, not me. I whipped out my sword and
struck at one of them. And just at that moment
Pythias was thrown in the struggle straight under my
blade. It cut him to the bone. Oh, if he had only
lived to exculpate me! If he had only spoken some
word. But there was no time. I saw only his eyes
raised to me in agony, in reproach. O priest—in terrible
reproach. Ah, I see them now! Wherever I go I
see them! The Eumenides are coming upon me. To
my children’s children will the curse run unless Apollo
will clean me.”</p>

<p>How Theria loved her father as he leaned toward the
man laying his hand upon the shaking shoulder, fearless
of the terrible curse which could run so quickly from
man to man.</p>

<p>“The Son of Leto will hear you,” Nikander said.
“Our god is pitiful of those whose hearts are clean. Do
not fear. To-morrow you shall consult the god. I
shall see that you go in first of them all to the Oracle.
Your case is needy.”</p>

<p>The interview was long. For as the man grew
quieter, Nikander did not fail to sound him as to his
attitude in the coming war. Every pilgrim was so
tested by Nikander. Thus Nikander learned the
public mind.</p>

<p>At Corobios’s departure Nikander wandered back
to where Theria sat. He was quite unaware that he
was seeking his daughter again.</p>

<p>Theria ran toward him with overflowing eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span></p>

<p>“Oh the poor man, the poor man! Father, surely the
Oracle will help him—it must help him!”</p>

<p>“The poor man, hey! What do you know about the
poor man? Theria, I will not have you listening from
corners—do you heed me?”</p>

<p>“But why did the dying Pythias reproach him?
Couldn’t he see that Corobios didn’t mean to hurt him?
Couldn’t he trust his friend that much?”</p>

<p>“Probably Pythias didn’t blame Corobios at all.
The eyes were in death-agony, already unconscious.”</p>

<p>“But will the Pythia tell him that? After all, how
can the Pythia help him? Corobios is a murderer—poor
man! poor man!”</p>

<p>“Corobios is not a murderer, Theria. Murder is of
the heart’s intention, not the hand’s mistake. Nay, his
hands are clean; cannot you see that?”</p>

<p>Nikander was forgetting the proper reproaches for
Theria’s eavesdropping. The question of blood-guilt
was a burning one at Delphi. It concerned a brand-new
policy of the Oracle: that sin was a thing of the
heart and not of outward accident. This moral advance
is, in every age, the most important and most
difficult for the human mind to achieve. Nikander
was fighting more battles than the defence against the
Persian.</p>

<p>“I wish,” said Nikander, “the people could see that
the curse does not come that way—without fault of
the accursed. Corobios is not under a curse.”</p>

<p>“Not under a curse?” repeated Theria. “Will the
god tell him that?”</p>

<p>“How do I know what the god will tell him?” answered
Nikander piously.</p>

<p>“Oh, if I were the Pythia I would pray the dear Son
of Leto till he gave me that answer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span></p>

<p>“But you are not the Pythia.”</p>

<p>On a sudden the wish of many moons sprang to
Theria’s lips.</p>

<p>“Father, let me be the Pythia, the next Pythian
priestess. Oh, Father, you do not know how I can pray
to the god and—and how——”</p>

<p>“Nonsense; the Pythian priestess is a stupid girl.
You would never do.”</p>

<p>“But the Pythia need not be a stupid girl,” Theria
was talking now breathlessly. “Father, when I pray,
Apollo answers me. He <em>does</em>.”</p>

<p>Nikander took her chin in his hand, lifting her pleading
face.</p>

<p>“What a queer child it is,” he mused. “What do
you mean by Apollo answering you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, Father; but he does. Oh, with the
coming down upon me of something out of the air like
wings—no, not like wings—but I know it is the god.”</p>

<p>Her eyes grew mystic with a curious inner seeing.</p>

<p>“You strange Theria,” said her father. “If you saw
all the visions of the gods it would not make you a good
Pythia. You know perfectly well that the Pythia is a
girl of empty mind. The mind must be vacant for the
god to speak through it. She is but the mouthpiece of
the god. Besides all this, she writhes in agony when the
oracle comes upon her. Sometimes it kills her.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t mind if it killed me, just so I were
Pythia,” Theria urged solemnly. “Just so I could
speak for the god.”</p>

<p>“Well, you’re not going to be Pythia, my child.
This whole question is nonsense. It grows out of nothing
but your eternal desire to be doing something.”</p>

<p>Nikander was right. It was Theria’s burning desire
to use the power that was in her which kept her constantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
urging. Her face turned tragic and Nikander’s
anger sharpened. He was under great stress.</p>

<p>“Now, no passion, mind. Theria, I have enough
burdens in these terrible days without your foolish notions.
Pythia—faugh! I’d be disgraced to have you
Pythia. Silly girl!”</p>

<p>So he strode out of the house.</p>

<p>Theria ran to her room. She expected to cry but she
did nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>“I <em>will</em> be Pythia,” she said, throwing her long arms
above her head and clasping her hands.</p>

<p>“I will be Pythia—no matter what——”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The springs of poet inspiration are hidden and very
strange. Could it be this opposition which drove
Theria to make her song—the prize song of Dryas?
The next day after these events that song came across
Theria’s mind like the flash. Anger was part of its
origin. Longing for outlet was another part. Strongest
of all was the damming back of the birth-right power
within her until it welled higher than its nature and
broke over into song.</p>

<p>It was the following week that she showed her song to
Dryas, and a yet further week when Dryas sang the
song at the Pythian festival and Theria snatched it
back again. The result was disastrous, as we have
seen.</p>

<p>And after her father’s whipping, Theria strangely
knew that she would soon do something to deserve another
whipping.</p>

<span class="smaller">“THE PLACE OF GOLDEN TRIPODS”</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Theria</span> awoke in the first grey of dawn. She
sat bolt upright in her narrow bed. A dream
had awakened her, or rather a purpose, a purpose
full formed in sleep. Awake, even her bold mind
could not have dared it.</p>

<p>Theria was going to dare to go out of the house! Out
into the free morning. Under the sky. Away through
Delphi. Up into the beloved Precinct. Oh, she would
see all of it—this once!</p>

<p>The consequence? Never once did she think of
consequence. She was simply doing what she did as if
a god had pushed her to it, feeling vaguely that she was
in the hands of her god. She sprang from bed and
threw about her bare lovely body her chiton, pinning
it at the shoulders. How her fingers trembled! Then
around her supple waist went her zone, drawn tight;
then came cloak and sandals.</p>

<p>The key to the front door was in her father’s room.
Nikander slept soundly, but Melantho slept, like puss
by the fire, with one eye open. “If they see me they
will whip me again,” she thought. “Well, what of
that?”</p>

<p>Noiselessly she stepped out upon the court gallery.
Everything in the court stood strangely distinct in the
dawn. Would she ever see again the little altar, the
swing that hung motionless in its place? No one could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
tell what might ensue if she went out. Theria stole
forward to her parents’ room.</p>

<p>Yes, they were asleep. The key was kept in the
chest among the book-scrolls. With an instinctive
prayer, she opened the chest and put her hand deftly
among the metal cylinders. But one of them settled
noisily into a new position. It clattered like a chariot
in her ears, and she crouched terror-struck. Her father
moved, sighed. The key was not there. In desperation
she arose and pushed her hands behind some clothes
on a peg. There, O Kairos! it hung. And grasping it
in her hand, Theria disappeared like a shadow, and so
descended the stair.</p>

<p>The porter would be near the door; but at this hour
surely in his lodge asleep. And Medon was growing
very deaf these days. He was hardly a fit porter, but
Nikander would not grieve the old man by taking away
his office. Theria had grace enough to feel a passing
regret that Medon through this escapade of hers might
lose his beloved duty.</p>

<p>Now she was at the door, fitting the great key into
its hole. Careful Medon was asleep but lying almost
across his door. Oh, if she could be quicker! If she
would not so lose breath! But slowly the door opened.
It did not creak—not very much.</p>

<p>She slipped through the crack.</p>

<p>Then, O Hermes, O gods of all open spaces and
swift feet! She was out of doors. She was under the
sky. So high that sky that she was dizzy looking up at it.
Not the accustomed low ceiling of the room or the narrow
opening above the court. It was the lofty treading
place of the Immortals. All the air in the world met
her first deep-taken breath—fragrance a thousand fold—the
uprising spirit of the morn meeting her spirit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span></p>

<p>She ran like a deer along the road in the grey silver
light. A marvellous place in which to be set free. A
vast amphitheatre of hills, spaceful and she in the midst
of the space. On every side in a far-flung circle rose
dim mountain forms to the silvery sky. On a nearer
hillside, aslant like a picture, lay the precious sanctuary,
framed four square within its clear-seen walls.
But within all was dim and confused, for the cliffs
which towered above it still had it in their shadow.</p>

<p>She stopped to gaze at it with that tenderness which
we feel toward things asleep and with a reverence born
of twelve generations of worship. Men of her blood
and bone had here met the god and here had builded
his temple. Hers the Precinct had been long before
she was born. Hers it would be when she was dead a
thousand years.</p>

<p>But how was she to get in? The Precinct was so
strictly guarded, the wall so high. Her spirit shrank as
she thought of it.</p>

<p>Suddenly Theria heard a footfall coming toward
her and quick as a thought she turned down one of
the steep streets. Once within the narrow blackness
she could see a little—could see the house doors set
down and down the terraces, and the Apollo statues
standing pillar-like beside each door. No one was
abroad in the street.</p>

<p>She passed down the better section and came below
into the slave quarter. Here a stench met her which
was almost more than she could bear. In this fetid
place doors were wide open and crowded slaves snoring
within. The sweat and weariness of slaves were the
very smell of the place. Was it here that Olen and the
kitchen slaves had to come after their day’s work was
done? Now she passed some half-naked women asleep<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
in the street. Great pity for them swept her, pity for
their slave life and slave lowness. She stooped over
one of them, gazing into her face.</p>

<p>The creature awoke with a howl of terror.</p>

<p>“Ye fool,” she cried. “Damned of Hades. If ye
come home late as this can’t ye keep still? Ho, I’ll
trounce ye.”</p>

<p>The woman leaped to her feet. Theria fled down the
street, turned the corner, and fled down another, the
woman in full chase, her cries arousing the quarter.
Here was real danger. This was the place where thieves
and ruffians hid themselves who came to rob the Precinct.
But even in her fright Theria had no instinct
to run home. She only fled farther away down the hill.
She outdistanced the woman, who presently gave up the
chase. Then Theria found herself below the town in
the depth of the glen.</p>

<p>She was hurt as if the woman had struck her. Never
had she heard loathsome oaths such as had been flung
after her. Their meaning filled her with horror. Thus
much had her cloistering done for her that it had kept
her whitely pure. She crouched like a wildwood thing
amid the bushes—confused, daunted. Then slowly her
determination came back, and she began to climb cautiously
upward.</p>

<p>At last she regained the highroad.</p>

<p>While this low adventure was chancing a whole new
world had been made—a world of dawn, of faint rose
and amethyst under an awakened sky, immense, marvellous,
holy.</p>

<p>Theria had emerged directly below the sanctuary.
Its great wall towered above her with glimpses over it of
temple roofs. Above all rose the great Phaidriades
cliffs, colossal, shutting out the east. Their colour now<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
was the ripe bloom of a plum from their base up to
where their clear-cut summits met the zenith. Theria
stood clasping and unclasping her hands. She was a
living spark of expectancy in that expectant morning
world. Here outside the wall near the gate stood the
victor statues. She could not but pause by one. She
knew its place well, her supple, young great-grandfather,
who had won the running match for boys. There he
stood, long limbed, spare, archaically smiling at her and,
for all time, fourteen years old. Dryas also would have
a statue here among the music victors. Tenderly
proud Theria marked the place for it near their ancestor.
In her present mood she had no jealousy or regret.</p>

<p>According to custom, ancient and immutable, Theria
must now pass by the Precinct and go onward some
distance to Castaly’s fount before entering the sacred
place. She wrapped herself in her cloak and hurried
forward.</p>

<p>She easily found Castaly—a pool glassy-still in its
rock-cut basin at the foot of the sheer cliff. It was
quite deserted and hidden from the road. Birds fluttered
up at her approach. A solemn place.</p>

<p>She looked about her. In mortal fear she took off
her cloak and dropped her chiton to her feet. So, like a
white nymph, very small at the foot of the cliff, Theria
stepped down into the sacred pool. She met the icy
water with a shivering cry, but she took the plunge. No
one might enter the temple who had not first bathed
here. She came out tingling, touched with ecstasy.
For holy Castalia cleansed the soul as well as the body.
Quickly she put on her garments, quickly walked back
to the Precinct.</p>

<p>She dared not even think now of the difficulty of
entrance. One terrible moment would decide. She<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
mounted the six steps to the Precinct gate, dipped her
trembling fingers in the lustral bowl—then knocked.
They were great bronze doors opening inward.</p>

<p>At once came steps within and the clanking of heavy
keys—the rasp of the unlocking. Then the doors
slowly, stingily, opened.</p>

<p>When she saw the keeper’s hideous face at the crack,
her courage sank in her.</p>

<p>“I want to come into the sanctuary,” said her faint
voice. “I want to pray to the god. I would like to
make a sacrifice.”</p>

<p>“Ye can’t consult no priests now,” said the man.
“They’re just gettin’ out o’ their beds.” Behind the
man she saw the glitter of the armed guard.</p>

<p>“I don’t want to consult a priest, I want to pray—to
pray for myself and my house.”</p>

<p>“Women like you ain’t got no house. Now get along
with you.” He was shutting the doors. Desperately
she laid her hand in the crack. “I pray you, I pray
you,” she cried. Then she tore off the himation which
wrapped her head. “Judge you whether I have a
house or no”—lifting her face—“I am a Nikander.”</p>

<p>“Great gods in Olympos!” quoth the keeper. “Ye
sure be.”</p>

<p>He opened the doors slowly, hesitating even yet.
The guard fell back.</p>

<p>“Line for line an’ feature for feature,” murmured the
keeper of the keys. “That daughter of Nikander’s.
It’s crazy she is. I’ve heard o’ her.”</p>

<p>Theria slipped through the narrow opening.</p>

<p>She was within! Locked into a wilderness of beauty.
Multitudes of little temples, red, blue, and gold; multitudes
of statues, some of hoary eld, some glossy new;
statues of wood, marble, bronze, standing under graceful<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
porticoes, or standing bareheaded by the wayside
looking out dreamily from life-like eyes.</p>

<p>And over all the still holiness of the morning the unearthly
light whose steady increase affected her spirit
like a joyous, irresistible call.</p>

<p>A child set free in fairyland? Oh, Theria was more
than that. A soul set in heaven, if ever heaven came
down to earth; and, in sooth, it sometimes does.
Theria’s soul leaped up from its depths. Suddenly
she could not see for the tears which filled her eyes. She
brushed them away impatiently. She must not waste
one moment of her seeing.</p>

<p>Right at hand stood the Athenian Gift after Marathon—statues
of Athenian gods and heroes standing so
friendly, mortal with immortal together in their portico.</p>

<p>“Ah, Athena, thou art dreaming of thine own hill in
Athens,” she cried, moving closer. “No, thou must not.
Be happy here, dear Athena.” Bred in the worship of
images, Theria quite forgot that all these were not alive.</p>

<p>Here was Miltiades. He who nine years ago had
won the battle of Marathon. He was a noble statue
in the new manner. Almost a portrait, with his curling
beard and fearless eyes. Theria touched his robe.</p>

<p>“It was thou who saved Hellas,” she said seriously.
“Oh, thou couldst do it, thou hast the look.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Theria realized that the light was much
increased. She had told her name at the gate. That
would mean quick capture. She must hasten. Before
her the white Sacred Way zigzagged boldly among the
treasuries up to the lordly temple of Apollo above
them all. In Delphi there is neither near nor far, but
only below and above.</p>

<p>Swiftly Theria chose out what she must see and what
she must pass by, perhaps never to see again. For<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
though she might some day walk here in processions she
could never linger as now. Every object had its story,
“history,” she would have called it, for she believed
them all.</p>

<p>Here near by was the Argive bronze horse given to
commemorate the Wooden Horse which Odysseus made
and gave to Troy. Everyone knew that tale. And
here was the Sikyonian Treasury. Theria must see
that, because it was the first little temple at the wayside
and was very old. It was round with a circle of chaste
pillars upholding the roof. She mounted the three
shallow steps. The doors had been just opened, for
some god had destined her to go in. The little circular
cella held many treasures, but of these Theria saw only
the central one—a book unrolled upon a marble table.
The antique lettering was of pure gold. Eagerly she
began to read. No one had told her of this book. It
was the epic poem of Aristomache of Erythrai, a
woman! Aristomache had won the prize at the Isthmian
games. Of course it was long ago. But a <em>woman</em>
had won it! The poem, how lovely, how much more
noble than Theria’s; but a woman’s, a woman’s!
Theria would try again, try to reach the high goal this
woman had set. Oh, she would try soon! She was
heartened and came out of that treasury with shining,
purposeful face.</p>

<p>Theria had lingered here longer than she had intended.
In haste she had to pass the treasuries higher up the
way, the Knidian—a little temple exquisite as a jewel
lifted high upon its tower-like foundation, its porch
upheld by tall, long-haired maidens—“Korai,” she
called them.</p>

<p>She began to meet caretakers on the way, yawning
after their night watch, going to their homes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span></p>

<p>Now came the first turn upward of the Way. Here
stood her beloved Naxian Sphynx, the one the top of
whose wing she had always glimpsed from her window.
How wonderful now, close at hand, high on her high pillar,
her breast covered with brilliant feathers, her blue
wings flung up lofty to the sky, her woman’s face
dreamily smiling. Ah, well she kept her wisdom to
herself, Mistress Sphynx! Theria knew she was dreaming
tenderly over the silent dead. For she was Gê,
mistress of earth and underworld.</p>

<p>Theria climbed dreamily higher up the Way, passing
now the threshing-floor where Dryas had enacted the
play. Memories, stories, faiths—all these swam together
in her mind until she dreamed herself away and
became part of the poesy about her.</p>

<p>Now the Sacred Way made its last steep turn. From
here the whole Delphic Vale burst into view. The Way
here ran upward and clung against the wall-like foundation
of the Great Temple, but on its outer side was a
veritable Olympos, full of gods and godlike men, statues
which would remake art if we could but see them now.</p>

<p>All were in action. Achilles on horseback and his
beloved young Patroclos running beside the horse and
gazing up at him. Apollo and Heracles both grasping
the tripod (for they had once had a quarrel over it).
The mother Leto and sister Artemis were trying to
quiet the angry god, and Athena was quieting the boisterous
hero. The eyes of these statues were set with
living coloured stones and looked in anger, command,
compassion, whatever they willed. No wonder Theria
shrank from them a little afraid.</p>

<p>Suddenly Theria was aware beyond the statues of
the great depth of vale—the Pleistos a silver ribbon
visible for miles, the hills away and away, and ah!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
the direct golden sunlight in long level shafts flooding
the vale. The sun had risen high over the mountain.
Her time was almost spent. She fairly ran up to the remaining
Way to the platform of the great Temple.</p>

<p>She stood breathless, awed before the greatest temple
of all Hellas. It was pure Doric. Grandeur spoke
from its mighty columns, repose from its perfect roof.
It was at once solemn and tender—man’s thought of
God made visible. And indeed the god breathed forth
in every line of it. No mere thing of white marble was
this. Gorgeous it faced the sunrise, crimson of column,
blue and orange of architrave, and golden griffined at
eaves and peak.</p>

<p>The doors were newly opened and he who had opened
them was busily brushing the threshold with a laurel
branch for broom. He was singing softly to himself.
Happy young priest at his happy task!</p>

<p>Theria came softly nearer. She knew what was in
the temple, every bit of sacred furniture and age-old
thing. She wanted to see each object, to treasure it in
her heart for ever. The young priest saw her and
stopped his sweeping in amazement.</p>

<p>“May I go in?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You know very well you may not,” was his answer.
Unlike the rude porter he knew that Theria was a lady.
“I cannot imagine, Despoinia, how you managed to
come up here.”</p>

<p>“I cannot imagine either,” she answered. The joy of
it overcame her and she laughed a gay ripple of laughter.
This angered the young man.</p>

<p>“You had no business to come here,” he said severely.
“You have disobeyed in coming, that I know, or you
would not be alone.”</p>

<p>Just at this moment an eagle circling down from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
cliffs above made a swoop like a falling stone for the
altar where the early sacrifice lay. Instantly the
young man seized a bow, near at hand for such adventure,
lifted it Apollo-wise, and shot the bird. The he
bounded down the temple steps to seize it.</p>

<p>And Theria quick as thought darted into her beloved
fane. How lofty it was within, the flickering light from
the hearth-flame playing everywhere and meeting
palely the day that poured in at the eastern door. This
hearth-flame was eternal and must never go out. An
old priestess was tending it. Theria paused by the
famous navel stone which marked the centre of the
earth. Who knows how many thousands of years men
had worshipped it. It was a rude stone, but immeasurably
holy. Two golden eagles were perched
either side of it—commemorating those whom Zeus had
sent to meet at Delphi. Farther within, near the
Statues of the Fates, was Pindar’s chair, waiting for
him always to come and sit and sing inspired songs—the
songful Apollo welcoming the human singer and
giving him of his own divine fire.</p>

<p>Theria bent and kissed the chair for the love she bore
the poet. As she did so her shoulder was seized and
roughly shaken.</p>

<p>“What do you mean by coming in here when I had
forbidden you?” said the furious priest.</p>

<p>Theria was too startled to speak.</p>

<p>“Answer me!” he shouted.</p>

<p>“I had wished for this,” she faltered. “Perhaps I
can never come——”</p>

<p>“I should say not.”</p>

<p>Theria came to herself and stood like a tall goddess.</p>

<p>“How dare you speak to me like that?” she cried.
“How dare you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span></p>

<p>But the priest seized her shoulder again. “Get out,”
he stormed. “The priests even now are coming up the
road with visitors. Get out, I say.”</p>

<p>Theria had no time for either dignity or resistance.
The youth pushed her out of the cella, across the temple
porch and down the steps.</p>

<p>She fled across the platform. A single glance showed
her the whole Precinct below. The little shrines, unearthly
in new golden light, the bronze tripods all
aglitter. Yes, and the Way! The priests coming up
the Way. She was in terror—not of punishment, but of
more unkindness. She was almost sobbing.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN PLEISTOS WOODS</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">She</span> sped across the road and hid behind the
Phokian offering. She could hear the priests’
pleasant voices talking of Delphi. From where
she stood a little path set out here behind the shrines
and treasuries. She followed it to the Precinct wall and
went searching for a side gate. Found one at last.
The keeper was almost asleep.</p>

<p>“Let me pass out,” she commanded. “Let me pass
at once.”</p>

<p>The man spat. “Now, Missy, this here lock’s rusty.
You go on down to the big gate. It won’t be far.”</p>

<p>“I will not go to the great gate. Be quick or I
shall have you punished.” Theria’s voice had a ring
of command. Besides, she did not speak the dialect of
women, but the speech of men.</p>

<p>“I will, Missy; I will,” hastily said the man, fishing the
key from his belt and fitting it. Noisily it creaked.
Theria twisted her fingers in nervous fear. She could
hear footsteps again. The Precinct was filling.</p>

<p>“It’s awful rusty, Missy: I can’t—— Ho, Hermes!
there it goes.” The door swung open and Theria
darted out.</p>

<p>Her Precinct hour was over. Where now to go?
What to do? She was bitterly lonely. “Dryas can
come to the Precinct whenever he will,” she thought
heartbrokenly. “And Father brings him there and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
tells him all things. But I—I am hounded out as if I
were a thief.”</p>

<p>She would not go home! No, she would not go home—not
yet. She crossed the highway into the eastern
end of Delphi town, and passed down through it to the
glen.</p>

<p>The glen was deeper here, even wilder than where she
had seen it below her home. It was so steep that no
buildings could cling. It was given over to wild olives
and laurel trees with gnarled roots, and to huge rocks,
the gift of earthquakes from the cliffs above. Theria
pushed doggedly down through it, tearing her hands,
bruising her feet. At last, after a special tumble, she
kirtled up her long chiton, pulling it up through her belt,
took off her himation and formed it into a long roll
which she tied about her waist. She was amazed at
the ease this gave her. No wonder the Goddess Artemis
could leap after the stag in this her special costume.</p>

<p>Now she was in the midst of stark, slender pine trees
which soared from the vale into the height to feather
out against the sun. She paused with upturned face.</p>

<p>“Are they always so solemn-thoughted, these dryads
here?” she asked herself. For of course each tree had
its dryad and the mood of the tree was the dryad’s own
mood. “Do they always pray so seriously to their
father Zeus?”</p>

<p>Theria would never willingly have come into the
forest. No Greek would have exchanged the man-beautified
sanctuary for this wild. But once here the
forest mysteriously received her. She who had never
before known the sweet ministration of trees began to
be strangely quieted. The forest distances, infinite yet
hidden, mobile, shifting with her every step, what a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
relief after the rigid walls of her house. How twilight-dim
it was. Yet sunlight filtered through the dimness—pools
of gold among the tree roots, shatterings of
gold on boles and boughs. Beneath her feet, which had
never trod aught save floor and pavement, was the deep
pine-needle mass springy under her step. She looked
down, wondering at it; a carpet no hands had ever
woven, or perhaps a carpet woven by some delicate god.</p>

<p>So the forest silence entered her heart—the silence
which is not silence at all, but the deep breathing of all
living things. She seemed to have grown wings which
would make her essentially free no matter in what
house of stone or clay.</p>

<p>But no, it was not the forest itself which received
Theria. She could never have conceived such a
thought. It was rather the thousand delicate dwellers of
the wood—dryads, fauns, satyrs, nymphs. These were
touching her with unseen hands. These were they who
dogged her footsteps with invisible service, who ceased
from their gay dances, slipping into invisibility, that she
might move across their place. Did she not see their
lairs among the ferns, and the footprints perhaps of
Artemis herself where she had crushed the starry mosses?
Most of these beings were sinister. They could lay
spells upon you. They could whisk you away into
sleep. But to-day they had no mischief in their hearts.
They were only kind.</p>

<p>Gradually came sweeping across the silence the voice
of a rushing stream. Theria pushed forward eagerly
to behold it—a lovely living thing, leaping, running,
singing, between its banks. It was the same little
stream she had seen falling down Castaly’s gorge, here
set free on the hillside. Who has not been touched by
the immortal force of moving water? Surely Theria<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
was touched by it. She knelt by the stream, stooped her
dark head low, her breast among the fern, and drank.
The ineffable fragrance of the waterfall met her—a fragrance
new to Theria.</p>

<p>Did not the gods breathe fragrance such as this? Ha,
the nymph Castalia—her veritable presence!</p>

<p>Theria sprang to her feet, hiding her face. At any
moment Castalia might be visible. No, no; Theria
would not spy upon her.</p>

<p>Fearfully she said the accustomed stream-prayer,
then took off her sandals and waded across. No Greek
would cross a stream without first asking its pardon.
Once on the farther bank she quickened her step, and
began to breathe again. A narrow escape was that
from a supernatural sight!</p>

<p>So noon came lordly into the sky, and afternoon.
Theria found herself in the enclosure of Athena Forethought,
the farthest shrine of Delphi; or its first, if you
came from the east. The Forethought Fane, a little
circular temple, was far above her on the road. She
could scarce see it for crag and tree. Here, weary with
wandering, Theria sat down to rest.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE POOR SLAVE</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">And</span> here so late, she met the adventure of her
day.</p>

<p>Sounds of distress brought her quickly to her
feet. She hastily wrapped herself in her himation.
She peered down the slope and could see the figure of a
man moving wildly about among the trees. Now he
lifted convulsive hands on high, now spread both arms
abroad and groaned. Greek woe never repressed itself.
It rather flung out, wind-swept, fiery, real. “But,”
thought Theria, “this must be some physical agony.”
She remembered her remedies at home, yet what could
she do for the man in this wild place?</p>

<p>She started down the hill. Nearer at hand she saw
that the man was a slave, rough bearded and clad
in an old slave cloak. Her adventure with the cruel
woman of the morning came back to her. A slave
might hail from any barbaric coast. Wild deeds, wild,
unthinkable crimes were committed by slaves. Theria
stopped in fear but at that moment the slave saw her.
His arms dropped to his sides, he gazed at her wide-eyed,
terrible—then suddenly pathetic.</p>

<p>“Forethoughtful One,” he faltered, “hast thou come
to punish or to save?”</p>

<p>What did the man mean? The “Forethoughtful One”
could be none other than Athena herself. Theria
laughed outright.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span></p>

<p>“Surely you do not think I am the goddess?” she
queried.</p>

<p>The mistake was not unnatural—Theria, slender
amid the slender trees, the light behind her, and all in
the Athena Precinct. However, the man looked a little
ashamed.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, Despoina, my lady. I am beside myself,
I—you startled me.” He was still wondering at
her. “You are a priestess?”</p>

<p>“You can see I am not,” she answered, businesslike.
“You are ill. I thought I might help you.”</p>

<p>Again he wondered at her. Then his face changed
back to its misery.</p>

<p>“I am not ill, Despoina, not bodily ill. My courage
is gone! The gods know how I shall ever pick it up
again.”</p>

<p>“What took your courage?”</p>

<p>He began to pace again.</p>

<p>“A slave’s tale; a miserable slave’s tale. Why
should you hear it? Oh, Mistress, you can do nothing,
nothing.” Yet he burst out with the telling.</p>

<p>“My freedom money. It is gone! Gone, I tell you.
My damned master knew all the while where it was hid.
He let me work and hope and hoard it. And now when
all but two drachmæ are there”—he held out his hand
with these last coins—“he came and seized it. The
beast! How can the just gods let such a man walk
the earth?”</p>

<p>Theria came nearer, interested, absorbed.</p>

<p>“You mean that you earned the money to buy your
freedom?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Despoina—to buy it from Apollo.”</p>

<p>He was referring to one of the noblest customs of the
Oracle. Both of them knew it well. A slave might<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
sometimes be so fortunate as to get money to buy himself
from his master. But the Greek master could seize
him again and once caught, the slave had no redress.
But Apollo of Delphi would buy slaves. They could
come to his temple and pay the money down to the god.
The terms of the transaction were engraved on the
stones of the temple foundation for all men to see.
Then the slave went free, protected by this divine ownership.
No former master would dare touch him.
Wherever the former slave might go, he was under
divine protection, Apollo’s ward.</p>

<p>“How long did it take you to earn the money?”
she asked.</p>

<p>“Four years, Mistress. Oh, gods! four long years. I
cannot do it again, and, if I did, would not my master
seize it as before?”</p>

<p>“How did you earn it?”</p>

<p>“My work is in the pottery, lady—the pottery there
below the hill toward Kirrha.” He showed her his
hands marred with the clay. “It is I who make the
best pictures on the pots.”</p>

<p>“I like those pictures,” spoke Theria. “They are
beautiful, those gods and men that you make.”</p>

<p>Tears ran straight down the man’s dirty cheeks.
Praise was rare for a slave.</p>

<p>“Do you think so?” he queried. “Do you think so,
my lady?”</p>

<p>Theria did not answer. She was thinking.</p>

<p>“My father, now. If you could bring your money to
my father, each drachma as you earn it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean me to begin all over again, my lady?
Then I will. If only my master does not take me away
from the pottery. He wants me for a body servant. He
is always threatening to take me for a body servant!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span></p>

<p>“But to be a body servant is easier,” said Theria.
Privately she was wondering what sort of a body servant
this uncouth man would make.</p>

<p>“I hate to be a body servant,” he said loathingly.
“Besides, I would not then know where to turn to earn
extra money.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Theria clapped her hands with a cry of
delight. “I have it! I have it!” she said. “I can help
you myself.”</p>

<p>The man gazed at her as if his faith in her goddesshood
had quite returned.</p>

<p>“I have jewels,” she went on, moving her hands in
her excited telling. “They are ancestral jewels and were
given me at my birth. I am supposed to give them to
my first daughter at birth. Well, my first daughter can
do without them. They are rich pearls. They are
worth more than the price of a slave.”</p>

<p>“Lady, lady! Oh, they would free me at once!”</p>

<p>“Yes, free you at once. But the matter is dangerous.
The priests may think you have stolen the jewels.
If they do, call for Nikander’s daughter.”</p>

<p>“Yes, blessed one.”</p>

<p>“And when you go to the Precinct ask for Kobon
as your priest. The Kobons are angry with us and have
never been in our house. Kobon will not recognize the
jewels.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” he said as if in a dream.</p>

<p>“But how to get them to you. Mother will not allow
me, Father will not—Baltè, no; no slave would dare to
do it for me. Besides, I hate to let slaves know anything.
They are so apt to tell.”</p>

<p>The man started out of his dream.</p>

<p>“I will not tell, Despoina.”</p>

<p>“You,” she laughed. “No, of course not, you will<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
be hastening off as far as you can go. You will be free.”
Then she added quite unintentionally, “Yes, you will
be free and I will be in my room again. Shut in—always
shut in!”</p>

<p>Of course Theria did not say this to the slave. She
said it to herself, because on a sudden she felt weak
and discouraged, felt her capture very near. The slave,
however, took note of her saying.</p>

<p>“How strange,” he said. “How strange—I never
thought——”</p>

<p>“What is strange?” she demanded.</p>

<p>“I never thought, Despoina, that wives and maidens
cared to walk abroad. They keep the house and seem
all content.”</p>

<p>It was the same comment that the lad Sophocles had
made, the very same. It roused her sudden anger and
flood of speech.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes. Be content, be content! Even a slave
dare mock me with that. And you yourself, what do
you want with <em>your</em> freedom? Why aren’t you happy
making pots? What is the difference between making
pots and spinning wool? What is the difference between
obeying a master and obeying a father, brother, uncle,
cousin; every man that is your kin? What have I to
look forward to? What to do—to do?”</p>

<p>The man fairly trembled before her outburst.</p>

<p>“Despoina! Dear, dear lady,” he kept trying to
make her listen. “I—fool that I was not to understand
the beautiful one. Despoina, hear me!” Something
in the man’s ardent voice frightened Theria. She
stumbled to her feet. But the man came nearer.</p>

<p>“Despoina, ah, poor lady, you have been away from
home many hours, have you not?”</p>

<p>“How dare you question me?” She walked away.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
She was dizzy, staggering. The man was following her.
What would he do, seize her? Carry her to Nikander’s
house for reward? Perhaps do worse than that?
“Do not go,” he urged. “Mistress, you are famished.
Forgive me, but we slaves know the look.” He snatched
from his wallet the rough brown bread, the day’s slave
ration. He pushed the bread into her hand.</p>

<p>“I pray you eat it. Not fit for you. Oh, I know that,
but if you do not eat you will faint here in the wood.”</p>

<p>She turned to him. Then suddenly she laughed.</p>

<p>“Hungry? Why, of course, I never thought of
hunger.”</p>

<p>She sat down, broke the tough bread, and began to
eat. The man ran down the hill to the stream and
returned with a little cup (one from his pottery)
brimming with fresh water. As he offered it he trembled
and spilled it awkwardly.</p>

<p>“Forgive me, lady. I am not a house slave.” How
breathless he seemed from his short run. “Dear lady,”
he added gently as to a child, “do not eat so fast; I
will guard. I will let no one come. I have cheese, too,
but I was afraid to give you that. I could not eat their
cheese at first myself.”</p>

<p>But she took it eagerly. It was atrocious stuff,
smelling horribly and perfectly green of colour.</p>

<p>“Isn’t it strange?” she said. “It tastes as good as
the daintiest fish. I never was hungry like this before.”</p>

<p>“My lady was never in the forest before,” said the
man. “The house breeds no appetite.”</p>

<p>“I have been long without food,” she confided to
him now. “I ran away before dawn and I never thought
to eat. I walked up into the sanctuary and saw all the
gods and temples and golden tripods. Oh, if they take<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
me home and whip me now and put me in the dark, they
can never take that away from me.”</p>

<p>“Whip—great Zeus, who would dare do that!”</p>

<p>“No one, no one,” she quickly answered. “Of course,
that was only jest.”</p>

<p>But his eyes still held the horror of it as he watched
her.</p>

<p>“Do you know,” she said, as she finished the last
morsel, “this bread has given me all the rest of my
precious day. With my hunger I would have had to go
home.”</p>

<p>“May it give you your hours,” said the slave devoutly.
“You who are giving me a life of freedom.”</p>

<p>Something in his manner of speech caught her
notice. It was well tuned and he used quaint words
which she had never heard before.</p>

<p>“You have not always been a slave,” she concluded.</p>

<p>“No, Despoina, that is why it is so hard to be a slave.
And when I saw the years ahead once more I cursed the
gods. Then you came, and I thought you were Athena
come to punish me for the cursing. Even now, dear
lady, I would not be amazed if you were to grow suddenly
tall and rise upward through the trees.”</p>

<p>He made an eloquent gesture. Then his eyes grew
fixed, staring at a place up the hill.</p>

<p>“Who is that?” he whispered sharply. “Do you
know them?”</p>

<p>She followed his look.</p>

<p>“Baltè!” she spoke almost with a sob. “And
Dryas, my brother.” Then she collected her thoughts
and began to talk quickly.</p>

<p>“The jewels! I have not told you how to get them.
There is a little street beside Nikander’s house. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
a window in the house that side. Come at twilight.
I will throw them down to you.”</p>

<p>She had hardly said the last word when the slave disappeared
among the bushes. Then she forgot him.
Dryas was there with his scorn, Baltè with her tears.
She had to face both.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SHATTERED CUP</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Bitterness</span> and confusion were Theria’s portion
when she reached home. Melantho was
ill from anxiety and stormed alternately at
Theria for her misdeed and at poor Baltè for not
taking better care of her. Dryas was very superior and
very wrathful. The slaves whisked hither and yon,
some delighted with the fuss, others scared as to which
way the storm might strike. Lycophron treated everything
with amused scorn, whether of Theria or her tormentors
could not be told. Nikander was away.</p>

<p>“But the whipping he’ll give you when he comes,”
declared Melantho, “will make that other whipping
seem a caress.”</p>

<p>Theria waited in a dumb terror. Not of the whipping,
but of her own reaction to it. She would fight back.
Oh, the disgrace of that! Deeper than all was the fear
of losing the last of her father’s love.</p>

<p>She had been sent to her room and poor Baltè watched
her like a Cerberus. No chance to be throwing jewels
from windows even if Theria had thought of it. As a
matter of fact, she forgot it utterly.</p>

<p>It was next morning before she met her father.</p>

<p>His face was darker than she had ever seen it. He
seemed to look at her strangely and from a great
distance.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, Theria,” he said, putting his hand to his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
head. “I am in too great anxiety to care whether you
are punished or not.”</p>

<p>“Father,” she exclaimed, instantly concerned for
him alone. “What—what has happened to you?”</p>

<p>“The Medes are at our door, child,” he strainedly
answered. “And at present I see no one who is going
to resist them.”</p>

<p>She laid hand upon his arm, but he hurried away out
of the house.</p>

<p>All that day Theria was in disgrace. Her mother set
her an extra long task of weaving and with extra severity
made her ravel out all her mistakes.</p>

<p>These were many. Theria could think of nothing but
her father’s worried words: “The Medes are at our
door.” The phrase rang over and over again in her
ears. The Medes were the Persians. Did Father mean
that the Medes were in Phokis—or on Mount Parnassos
itself? How soon would they fall upon Delphi? Oh, if
she could only question her mother. But her mother
would know nothing about it.</p>

<p>In the midst of her worry her promise to the slave
concerning the jewels flashed across her mind. “But it
was last night I was to give him the jewels, last night,
poor slave. He must have come—and gone away again.
Will he come to-night? Oh, surely he will.”</p>

<p>She went immediately to her room and took from her
jewel box a necklace. It was of pearls strung upon
horsehair. A mother-of-pearl amulet depended from it.
This she tried to remove, for it was characteristic,
easily identified. But a sound along the corridor
made her swiftly hide the necklace and all in her bosom.
Moments alone were rare to-day. She must have the
jewels ready. Of course the adventure pleased her.
She was young and she was—Theria!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span></p>

<p>After the family had dispersed from the last meal of
the day she sped away to the back storeroom. There
at the window she waited. Never had so many steps
sounded in the house, coming near the door, passing and
repassing; never had the lane reëchoed so loudly the
footsteps from the highway. Again and again she
thought people must be entering the lane itself. Once
Nerea came into the storeroom to fetch wheat for the
kitchen. But it was by no means unusual to find the
little mistress sitting at that window, and Nerea went
innocently away.</p>

<p>Down in the lane the shadows crept closer. Deep
twilight now. There among the jagged rocks at the
lane’s end was a denser shadow. Suddenly bird-swift
the shadow darted forward and stopped under her
window. She leaned out.</p>

<p>“Hist! is it you, slave?”</p>

<p>The bearded face uplifted itself, the hands as well.
She could see this in the dimness.</p>

<p>“Oh, marvel of kindness,” came the low voice, “I
knew you could not fail.”</p>

<p>“But I forgot yesterday. Hold your hands up close
together. Careful, now.”</p>

<p>She dropped the pearls and he caught them easily.
But he stood still in his place.</p>

<p>“They did not whip you yesterday, Despoina? Tell
me they did not,” he whispered.</p>

<p>“Of course not, Fool! Go quickly, you will be
caught. Go!”</p>

<p>He flung his hands upward again. Poor creature, the
gesture was a very speech of gratitude. Then he
slipped back to the enfolding rocks.</p>

<p>Theria suddenly recalled how once she had found a
bird in the court and had taken it to this window to set<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
it free. Even so had it flung itself off and was gone.
Her fancy pictured the slave hiding for the night among
the rocks; then, at break of day, hurrying down to the
Precinct to purchase freedom from the god. Ah, by to-morrow
he would be miles and miles away. He would
not wait for the jewels to be questioned. That problem
would be hers.</p>

<p>She went off to bed singing softly a little tune.</p>

<p>Next afternoon Olen, her father’s slave, came into
Theria’s room. He seemed furtive in his errand.</p>

<p>“I was to give you this,” he said, and handed her a
small two-handled bowl. He was for hurrying out, but
Theria stopped him.</p>

<p>“What is this, Olen?” she asked.</p>

<p>“You know best, Mistress,” he said, hiding a smile.</p>

<p>It was a shallow bowl, one of those made in the
pottery below the hill. Within the bowl was a delicate
figure of the goddess “Athena” so the letters said above
the figure. She was bestowing something upon a supplicant
who stood before her.</p>

<p>“Who gave you this bowl, Olen?” asked Theria, puzzled.</p>

<p>“A man, Mistress, a sorry-looking slave with clay
matted in his hair.”</p>

<p>Theria turned the bowl about. On the under side
was an unburned painting of a youth standing tip-toe
with arms outstretched as if to fly. The drawing was exquisite,
but exquisite drawings were common in Greece.
Above the youth was scrawled:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Eleutheria gives freedom.</p>
</div>

<p>Theria blushed slowly, angrily red. She held forth
the bowl and broke it to shards against the house wall.</p>

<p>“Olen,” she said sternly, “never bring me messages.
Never bring me gifts.”</p>

<span class="smaller">GATHERING THE THREADS</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Nikander</span> had spoken of the Medes but in a
voice so low that none but Theria heard.</p>

<p>Theria, Nikander knew, would not give way to
fear. However, she did give way to curiosity. She
questioned Medon, but Medon would tell her nothing.
“Your father has forbidden us, Missy,” was his word.
She plied Olen with questions, but Olen backed away
from them with a skill which slaves acquire. As for
Baltè, she could only say:</p>

<p>“Oh, darling, it is tribes and tribes of men, all the men
in the world coming against our Greece. And the king
at their head is a god. Where he will he knocks a
mountain over, like <em>that</em>, an’ when he will he makes the
sea dry land for his tribes to walk over. He is goin’
to burn every city of Greece.”</p>

<p>Theria, what with her love of her land and her love of
mere knowing, felt actually ill from all this bafflement.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon she caught Lycophron walking
across the aula.</p>

<p>“Lycophron, stay with me! Talk with me only a little
while. I’ll have Olen bring wine and the fresh cakes.”</p>

<p>“Now, Sis, what are you up to?” he asked. Her
eyes were wide and starry. At such times they had
the look of being new opened like a child’s.</p>

<p>“And Circe put wine before the Mariners,” he quoted,
laughing. She finished the lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span></p>

<p>“You rogue,” he said. “I believe you know the
whole of Homer by heart. Very improper for a girl.”</p>

<p>“No, I don’t; I only know most of the Odyssey.
But don’t talk about that, please. Oh, please tell me
of the war.” She caught his arm pleadingly. “Nobody
but you will ever tell me anything. I am not afraid
about the war.”</p>

<p>“But you’d better be,” he said shortly.</p>

<p>“Old Baltè says the great king is a god who makes the
land a sea and the sea dry land.”</p>

<p>“Well, do you know, that is truth—almost. Xerxes
has dug a canal across the peninsula of Athos, behind
the stormy mountain, to give safer passage to his ships,
and he has built an enormous bridge across the Hellespont
for his tribes to walk over. They were nine days
and nights passing over the thing, a constant stream.
It seems foolish for him to transport so many men to
Greece. He could conquer our little states with a fifth
of that number.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean he brings too many?” queried Theria
keenly.</p>

<p>“Gods, no! The great king knows what he is about.
He’s an enemy to be reckoned with! I don’t say we
should throw up our hands and <em>Medise</em> all at once. But
surely we should treat with him before we try to fight
him. Why should we go out with a handful of men and
ships to be butchered? Schutt!” he snapped his fingers
scornfully. “That Tempè business! Do you know about
Tempè?”</p>

<p>“No,” breathlessly.</p>

<p>“Well, they started out—the Athenians and the Spartans
together and—— Now, Sis, you may as well know that the
Persians are coming really against Athens and
Sparta. Them only. None of the rest of us are in this<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
fight at all. And I say there’s no need of our throwing
ourselves into it like geese. Well, they start out, these
Athenians and Spartans, and go to the Vale of Tempè
where they say there is a pass where they can keep the
Persians from coming through. And when they get
there they find <em>two</em> passes into Greece instead of <em>one</em>
pass to defend. So back they come like whipped curs.
I can hear the Persian king roar with laughter when he
hears of it. This was last week. The news of their
fizzle is all over Hellas. It’s taken the heart out of
everyone. You’ve seen a hare sitting with ears up ready
to run. That’s the way we are!”</p>

<p>“Oh,” breathed Theria. She was leaning forward,
drinking the news. “That is what ails Father. That
Tempè failure. Not that he is scared,” she corrected
herself. “But so troubled, so deeply troubled.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he’s troubled. The difficulty with Father is,
he is trying to butt into a stone wall. I suppose he’ll
see after a while, the old dear!”</p>

<p>“Don’t call him that, Lycophron. Father isn’t old.
What do you mean by butting a wall?”</p>

<p>Lycophron stretched out his hands, yawning: “Oh,
Sis, you want to know the history of the Oracle since
the time of Gaia,” he said. Then suddenly a shrewd,
purposeful look came into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Look here, puss. If I tell you about it will you try
to help Father? Father’s going against the Oracle.
The Pythia says one thing but Father thinks another.”</p>

<p>Now Theria’s faith in her father was second only to
her faith in her god. “He wouldn’t do that,” she
exclaimed. “How can you say that of Father? Father
is——”</p>

<p>“Now, now; don’t get so hot all of a sudden! Wait till
you hear: Athens has sent to Delphi asking—‘Shall we<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
fight the Persian and if so how will we come out?’ The
Pythia gave them a discouraging answer. Then the
Spartans came. Discouraging answer again. Something
about ‘a king shall die to save you.’ But not
clear. Now Father wants them to keep on asking again
and again until better answers come. That’s pretty
near sacrilege!”</p>

<p>He paused a moment.</p>

<p>“All the answers are the same, Sis. The answer to
the Cretans: I heard that myself, heard the priestess
give it. Confused, of course, but after the priests deliberated
over it, clear as a whistle. ‘Keep out of the
fight,’ it said. ‘Do you want to be whipped as the
Phokians whipped you?’</p>

<p>“Now Father is horrified at that. He says the Oracle
meant nothing of the kind. He had a terrific argument
against all of them in the Council. He’s making enemies
right and left. What worries me is that man Kobon.
The Kobon family have always hated us and Kobon—well,
he’d like to destroy Father. Now here is his
chance. Sooner or later he’ll do it unless Father stops
what he is doing.”</p>

<p>Theria was speechless with horror. Lycophron leaned
toward her earnestly.</p>

<p>“Look here, Sis, why don’t <em>you</em> talk with Father? You.
I can’t talk to him any more. He won’t listen to me.
Try to tell him what I’ve told you. Of course he’ll be
angry. He’ll say you know nothing about it. But it may
count if you tell him you’ve been warned. He’s bitter
discouraged now. It may count. Will you do it?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes!” she said.</p>

<p>Lycophron kissed her. He was really an affectionate
fellow and considered his sister a charming child. Then
he hurried out of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span></p>

<p>Her father was in danger! Her father might be
destroyed! This fact overtopped all others in Theria’s
loving mind. Even the impending war was dim in this
presence. And at nightfall Theria learned that her
father had gone away from Delphi. He had gone on
some mysterious business. Lycophron had seen him
depart but even he did not know Nikander’s destination.</p>

<p>For the next two weeks Theria was well-nigh impossible
to live with. Her temper took fire at everything.</p>

<p>“I cannot sit and spin,” she declared. “Ah, gods;
but I cannot!”</p>

<p>She threw down her distaff, defying her mother’s authority.
In her room she paced up and down, maddening
for activity. “If only Father were here,” she would
repeat. “If only here, so that I might plead with him
to keep out of danger.”</p>

<p>But if Nikander should come, would she dare to
question him and his state policies? Never in her life
had she doubted her father’s wisdom. Theria had in
some way gleaned a knowledge of Nikander’s far-reaching
powers—Nikander who seldom thought in terms
of the individual but nearly always in terms of the state.
But now his statecraft was bringing him into personal
danger. That very danger made him seem to her in
the wrong. Yet to question him face to face, that
seemed to Theria the height of impiety. What could
she, an ignorant girl, say to so wise a statesman? Yet
persuade him she must. He was in danger—in danger!</p>

<p>From this perturbation Theria found her old solitary
place in the back storeroom an only refuge. Here she
could at least breathe the air, could see the turbulent
stream, could watch the gradual increase of nooning
light or its golden decline.</p>

<span class="smaller">A YOUTH UNDER THE WINDOW</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">One</span> evening she had sat there until the violet
twilight gathered and the stream down in the
lane ran uproarious among the damp mists.
Presently she heard footsteps and looking down saw
emerge from the hill a youth, a beautiful lithe fellow,
walking with that swift grace that youth is heir to.
He looked directly to her window and threw out both
arms as if in surprise and greeting.</p>

<p>Theria retired at once. She was quick enough for
adventure, but not this sort of adventure. She had no
taste for romantic secrecies. But the youth stopped
under her window.</p>

<p>“Lady,” he called, low but intensely. “For love of the
gods do not go away! I have not come to harm you.”</p>

<p>Something in his tone—earnestness, a tragic need—brought
her back to the window. There he was standing
with upturned face, beautiful in the twilight. But
now having her in sight he did not speak. He only
lifted up his hands toward her with an energy as though
he would spring upward.</p>

<p>Could this be her cousin Agis or Caramanor, one of
those with whom she had played as a child? Was he
bringing her news of her father? He seemed to have
come with purpose.</p>

<p>“What news have you, Cousin?” she asked anxiously.</p>

<p>“The news that I see your face—your face!” answered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
the astonishing fellow. “Oh, all my happiness
harks back to you. All my freedom to be a man is of
your making. Do not wonder that I thank you—that
I must see you and speak my thanks to your face.
Every breath waking and sleeping I thank you.”</p>

<p>“But who are you?” asked Theria, amazed. “Are
you mad? You have nothing to thank me for.”</p>

<p>He was the more delighted.</p>

<p>“Ahai, my lady! you do not recognize me. Nay,
forget the one you saw before. You with your jewels
have made me a new man.”</p>

<p>Then Theria’s mind leaped back over the two weeks
and she guessed.</p>

<p>“But, love of Leto, you cannot be that slave!”</p>

<p>“No, no; I am not he, I am free!”</p>

<p>“I don’t believe you are that slave. You have no
look of him. You are straight. You are young.”</p>

<p>“I had almost forgotten I was young. I had kept
that disguise so long. And how I hated it—the dirt,
the miserable matted beard, the stooping. It took me
days to stand straight again.”</p>

<p>“Was it not bad enough to be a slave without making
yourself like that?” said Theria disgustedly.</p>

<p>“Dear maid, I had to keep so. They would certainly
have sold me into Persia. There is great price
in the East for beautiful men.”</p>

<p>He said this frankly of himself as a matter of course.
Indeed there was something startling in his beauty—an
ethereal quality, though he was manly too, but now
so full of delight that he seemed like a child. He began
hurriedly to tell her of himself.</p>

<p>“Dear lady, I was not born a slave. You will believe
that. I was taken at sea by pirates—the whole ship
seized. They put us below in the dark hold of their<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
ship and fed us on nuts. That first night I blacked my
face with the nut-hulls. I exchanged garments with
the meanest man among us. I——”</p>

<p>“But why?” asked Theria.</p>

<p>“I had heard the sea-robbers upon deck above talking
of me—and how they would sell me to the Persian
Court.” A horror crossed the youth’s sensitive face.
“Lady,” he said, “the Persians would have shamed me
and made me worse than slave. I would do anything to
escape that. In the morning, when the pirates came
down looking for me, they thought their beautiful
youth had jumped overboard. Stupid Phœnicians.”</p>

<p>This Odyssey was holding Theria fascinated. She
forgot all the proprieties. She forgot that the youth
might be love-making. Her mind had moved so many
days in a doomed circle that now it spread wings of new
life.</p>

<p>“But you got home again. How ever did you manage
that?” she questioned.</p>

<p>“For long I was a galley slave. But one day, when
the ship stopped at Corinth, I won the captain’s attention
and told him of my skill in making gods of stone.
Then he sold me to an image maker, and the image
maker again to the owner of the pottery here. Oh,
those days at the pottery! Those endless days! The
dirt, the sweat, the low talk, the beatings if work was
not swift enough. For I was not a swift worker. I
had to make even those poor slight drawings as beautiful
as I could. My only life was in them. I would
dream over them. Then the overseer would beat me.
But those days are over. Think of it, lady. Can you
think how happy I am being away from that?”</p>

<p>“Great Hermes, yes! And then you went up the
Precinct with my jewels?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, blessed one. The next morning after you gave
me them the good god freed me. I came down out of
the Precinct gate knowing that I was free. I went
straight to Argos. I think I sang all the way. Argos
is my home.”</p>

<p>His face saddened unexpectedly. “Dear lady, I had
been long away. I found that my father was dead and
also my lady-mother, for grief at losing me—and—and
I found something worse than that—even than that.
Great Hera!” he lowered his voice. “Argos had
Medized. My father’s dearest friend confessed it to
me. The Argives say they are bargaining for the headship
of the All-Greek army. They are really doing
nothing of the kind. They have Medized. They have
made a real compact with Persia—nothing less! Lady,
I had lived so long in dread of Persian slavery and there
at home to meet it again! But I will not meet it,” he
cried with sudden energy. “I will not! So I have
come back here to Delphi. But I loved Argos so
dearly!”</p>

<p>“Of course you did. Your home! Dreadful! Argos
Medized!” Theria hardly know that she spoke.</p>

<p>“I’ll fight the Persians here. Here in Delphi. You
will surely need every man you can get. I shall become
a Delphian. I have a little fortune, lady,” he
added, very businesslike. “My father’s good friend
saved it for me. I can buy citizenship in Delphi.”</p>

<p>Then suddenly the moral of the tale was out.</p>

<p>“And, lady, with my fortune and my citizenship, I
shall ask your father for your hand in marriage. But
not against your will. I will not enslave you who have
made me free. Oh, dearest lady, love me, love me, love
me!” he hurried on. “Cannot you see what the
Cyprian has done to me toward you?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span></p>

<p>Theria rose from the window as though the youth had
struck her.</p>

<p>“How dare you, how dare you?” She gasped.
“Words not meet for a maid to hear.”</p>

<p>“Lady,” he called so loud that she came back to her
window for very caution. “Hush, hush,” she whispered.
“Will you disgrace me?”</p>

<p>“No, no; lady, I pray for you, I bless you to the immortal
gods.” He beat his palm against the house
wall for emphasis. “Can you stop the stream of Castaly
flowing down from the cliffs?” he questioned passionately.
“No more can you stop the stream of my love.
It will refresh and bless you whether you will or no. Ah,
what I would do for you, dear child, if I only might.”</p>

<p>He tossed With a skilful fling a bunch of fresh ferns
into her window. Then he was gone.</p>

<p>If the stream of Castaly had indeed fallen on Theria’s
head she could hardly have been more shocked. She
stood in the middle of the room angered into tears, hurt,
strangely frightened. How dared the man return her
kindness in this fashion? When a man wanted a friend
he took a man, creature of his own mental stature, not
a girl.</p>

<p>Well did Theria know that love-making was
disgraceful and not for high-born maids. Pure girls
dreamed of marriage, of course, but not of love. Theria
had dreamed of neither. She picked up the scattered
ferns and tossed them out of the window. Their
delicate scent of the wild wood met, her as she did so.
Suddenly she longed for her mother’s touch and voice,
even her scolding voice. She hurried out of the room.</p>

<p>But as she went to sleep that night she remembered
only that Argos had Medized.</p>

<span class="smaller">GATHERING MORE THREADS</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> next morning Nikander returned to his home.
He retired at once to rest after his journey.
Theria met him as he came forth again from his
room in the late afternoon. It was plain that no sleep
had been his. He was haggard. There was something
in his face which cut Theria to the heart. She put
herself directly in his path.</p>

<p>“Father,” she said, “I know your trouble. Do not
hide it from me. You think I cannot help you, but,
oh, let me try.”</p>

<p>The love outgoing from her face and from the little
trembling gesture of her hand—these he could not
choose but see.</p>

<p>“You say a great deal when you say that you know
all about my trouble,” he smiled.</p>

<p>“Don’t laugh at me, please. I am a grown woman.
I am sixteen years old.”</p>

<p>“What is it you want to know, child?”</p>

<p>“About the Persians,” she said breathlessly. She was
daring the question now. What a fool she felt herself to
be! “If they’re really coming against only Athens and
Sparta couldn’t the other states stand aside—and keep
out of it—wouldn’t it be best?”</p>

<p>His face went black.</p>

<p>“Theria, who has been talking to you?” he demanded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>“Nobody, Father. We hear things in the house.
We can’t help hearing them. I heard, too, that Argos
has Medized. I wanted to tell you that. The Pythia’s
answer had nothing to do with it. They Medized long
before. They are in actual league with the Persian!”</p>

<p>Nikander looked as if she had dashed water in his
face.</p>

<p>“By the thundering Zeus, how did you know that?
The priests only made certain of it last night.”</p>

<p>“It’s because I want so much to know, Father, that I
learn. And I know that you are in bitter danger from
Kobon. Are you sure”—she caught her breath before
the plunge—“are you sure you are right? Are you sure
that <em>all</em> the states should fight the Persian? Wouldn’t
it be better to treat with the Persian just as the Oracle
bids us do?”</p>

<p>This time his eyes flashed with anger. “Am I to hear
myself flouted,” he said, “by the very women of my
household?”</p>

<p>She suddenly threw both arms about his neck in a
passion of tears.</p>

<p>“No—no—no—I am not flouting you! Kobon!
He may kill you. Any day he may kill you.”</p>

<p>“That side of the question is not to be dwelt upon,”
he said severely. He put his arm about her, but his
face was like a mask.</p>

<p>“Come with me,” he said.</p>

<p>He led her into his room and shut the door. She
could not tell whether he would punish her or not.</p>

<p>“Do you know what is meant by ‘treating with the
Persian’?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It means to be his slave, to submit to his rule in ways
that would ruin the freedom of Greece. We Greeks<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span>
could meet in our Councils—oh, yes, we could <em>meet</em>!
But the Councils would count for naught. The Great
King’s word would be law. It would mean that we
would be called out to fight the King’s battles, not our
own—that he would take our young men to his court
and make eunuchs of them, take our young girls for his
concubines. Don’t you think that any state of Greece
should prefer death to such a fate?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes,” she whispered with wide eyes. At
last she was to know the truth.</p>

<p>“Yet this is the fate you tell me Argos prefers. I
suppose,” he added whimsically, “you know all about
the Council at the Isthmos of Corinth, from which I
have just come.”</p>

<p>“No, nothing of that.”</p>

<p>“Then I will tell you. Athens, Sparta, and all the
lesser states who want to defend our Hellas have sent
representatives to this congress. They are making
our plan of defence. They have sent envoys to all the
doubtful states of Greece, begging them to join in the
fight. Now, here, my child, is my grief and should be
yours—these states, Argos, Crete, and others sent at
once to our Pythia to ask whether or not they should
enter the war. And in every case the oracles have been
negative. It has been so when there was no need.</p>

<p>“You know, my child, that oracles are not always
clear! Just as prayers to the gods are not always
answered. And when the oracles are not clear, surely
it is because the Son of Leto wishes us to use our own
wisdom in the interpretation thereof.</p>

<p>“These oracles to Argos and Crete came forth in
confused utterance and could have been interpreted
into splendid words of courage to those states. We
could have <em>forced</em> them to join the League.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span></p>

<p>Nikander’s voice began to ring with his message. He
forgot it was only to his daughter, Theria, that he was
speaking. She meanwhile thrilled and quivered with
the sudden enlightenment. Yesterday she had been for
the moment persuaded by Lycophron. But this from
her father was the truth, so clear that she ought to
have known it without any telling.</p>

<p>Nikander went on:</p>

<p>“But all the priests were for bending the oracles the
other way. They fashioned them into drivelling nonsense,
only adding enough of sense to warn the states
away, to make them afraid to fight.</p>

<p>“Oh, that our Delphi should come to this.</p>

<p>“The priests themselves are scared. Many of them
have visited Persia and remember its vast power.
I, too, have visited it. What of it? Cannot they see
that in a pass like this the gods will fight on our
side?</p>

<p>“But among all the priests, only Timon and I are for
the nobler part. I am not accustomed to failure. I do
not know how to bear it.”</p>

<p>His head bowed, but it lifted again quickly.</p>

<p>“But we have not failed yet, Timon and I. There
are yet Athens and Sparta for us to help.”</p>

<p>Suddenly he seemed aware of his daughter. He took
her hand.</p>

<p>“Athens and Sparta prefer death to the Persian rule.
They are going to fight the Persian though he be twenty
times their number. Do you see nothing fine in that,
my child?”</p>

<p>Her wide-open eyes answered him.</p>

<p>“Up till now the Oracle has disheartened them both.
It shall not dishearten them again. Athens and Sparta
will certainly visit the Oracle once more. If I have to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
die in giving them the message of the god, that is a
small matter. The message shall be given.”</p>

<p>Theria moved toward him in awed, shining acquiescence.</p>

<p>“Father,” she said clearly, “if you have to die that
way, I will not cry out any more.”</p>

<p>Nikander framed her white face in his two hands.</p>

<p>“My darling child!” he said in a kind of amazement.
“How strangely you understand.”</p>

<p>She felt his hands tremble; then he smiled almost
merrily.</p>

<p>“But I do not intend to die, Theria. I intend to
win!”</p>

<p>Her trust in him now was too complete for her even
to urge her own help upon him.</p>

<p>“I will not ask you again, Father, to make me Pythia,
but if I can help you that way or any way, you will let
me—you will let me?”</p>

<p>“Persistent Theria! You cannot help me by being
Pythia. How many times must I tell you that the
Pythia is the empty mouthpiece of the god.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father,” she consented.</p>

<p>“You can help me,” he said, “by keeping up the
courage of the household. Do not let the slaves talk.
Don’t let your mother cringe and worry. Most of all,
do not be surprised at anything. I’ll tell you now the
fullness of it. The Persians will come to Delphi. No
amount of treating will keep their greedy hands off
this rich spoil. Our streets will know their footsteps,
our temples and households their desecration.</p>

<p>“They are a great horde. All the armies of the past
taken together will not make the sum of them. Yet we
must fight them. There is no other choice, my child.
Can you keep a brave heart and stiff will?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span></p>

<p>“Yes,” she answered. “Yes.”</p>

<p>She went back to her room exalted and actually refreshed.
The danger was so great, so certain, that it
bred not fear but only a deep solemnity.</p>

<p>Nikander, however, walking out into the street, was
not encouraged by this conversation, but miserably
cast down.</p>

<p>He had received sympathy; but not from his sons
had he received it. The fullness of Theria’s understanding
but made him feel the more keenly their aloofness.
This poor child, a daughter! wanted to help him
by becoming the Pythia—futile effort! Yet the only
one open to her. His sons, had they desired, might
have been already in the priesthood, fighting by his side
for this—the greatest cause the Oracle had ever known.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, he must fight alone. In bitterness of
heart he made his way through the midsummer heat
up toward the Council House.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE SONG RE-SUNG</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Theria’s</span> first thought was to deal with Lycophron.
That afternoon she met him in the
outer aula. He questioned her first.</p>

<p>“Sis, did you speak with Father?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and oh, Lycophron, Father is right about the
oracles. You haven’t quite understood. He explained——”</p>

<p>“Shu!” he interrupted. “I might have known it
would turn out that way. You take Father for a god.”</p>

<p>“Don’t talk that way, Lycophron. You know yourself
how wise he is. You know how the priests have
always looked up to him.”</p>

<p>“Do they? Now? In this crisis?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“No, but that is the more reason we should stand by
him. We should think and act with him. Lycophron”—she
caught the corner of his himation, twisting
it in her fingers—“you could really go into the Council
yourself if you wished. You are old enough. Your
vote would help his.”</p>

<p>“But I wouldn’t vote his way, Puss.”</p>

<p>“Do talk with Father,” she pleaded. “He will make
you understand. He talked of it with me” (she said it
proudly). “How much rather would he talk with you.
He would make it all clear.”</p>

<p>“Now, Sis, it’s you that are butting into a wall.
Father and I don’t agree in these matters. You’re a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
smart little girl, but don’t try to meddle in things too big
for you. By the way, when are you to be betrothed?”</p>

<p>She paled quickly and Lycophron laughed. Theria’s
reluctance to marriage was a curious streak of idiocy in
this quick-witted sister of his. Lycophron thought it
comic.</p>

<p>“Great Hermes, what a face you make!”</p>

<p>“Father hasn’t said anything about betrothal, has
he?” she queried.</p>

<p>“Well, I won’t say whether he has or not,” he teased,
“but I shall remind him. I met Theron the other day,
‘When am I going to get my beautiful wife?’ says he.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Lycophron, please, please!” she begged, all in a
tremble. “Don’t remind Father, do not tell him what
that man——”</p>

<p>“Why, Sis, you little fool, a betrothal is a fine
festival. And you would be coming right down among
the men. It would be the merriest time you ever had in
your life—and you the centre of it all.”</p>

<p>“Who would want a merry time,” she retorted,
“when the Persian is coming to tear us to pieces?”</p>

<p>“No; don’t you be scared to death like Dryas.”</p>

<p>“You know I am not scared!” she said so indignantly
that Lycophron patted her shoulder approvingly.</p>

<p>“There, there, Sis, I won’t remind Father. But,
honestly, I do think it is a shame that he forgets to betroth
you just because he is so busy in the Council.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad he forgets,” she said vehemently. “I’m
glad he forgets.”</p>

<p>After a moment she asked with anxiety:</p>

<p>“But is Dryas really scared?”</p>

<p>“He doesn’t say so, but I can tell that he is. He
turns white about the lips.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I am so sorry, so sorry,” she answered. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
break up of the family front was more serious than she
had supposed. “But,” she concluded, “Dryas will
stand by Father whatever happens.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>For a week Theria kept away from her storeroom and
its beloved window. Cruel, that the impudent stranger
should deprive her of her refuge. The storeroom was
her place of intimate solitude. It was saturated with
her thought, her dreams, her songs. The little window
and the lonely street—all were hers.</p>

<p>But after a time her fears lessened. Surely the
youth would not keep coming all this while, or if he
did, she had only to tell her father. Nikander would
punish him thoroughly. Yes, and perhaps his daughter
also for being at the window at all. Oh, but the youth
must have forgotten. Why need she be anxious? The
evening was very hot. The air seemed to press down
heavily into the amphitheatre of the mountains. One
could hardly breathe.</p>

<p>Theria found her window. Darkness had fully come
and the hoped-for breeze. She had sat there some
moments before she realized that the Argive youth
was in the lane below. She shrank back, but his first
word startled her into speech.</p>

<p>“Lady Eleutheria, I have asked your father for your
hand,” he said. “But oh, dear maid, he tells me that you
are betrothed.”</p>

<p>“I am not betrothed! I am not betrothed!” she
cried vehemently. “There has been no betrothal.”</p>

<p>“Thank the good gods for that,” was the devout
answer.</p>

<p>Foolishly she began to argue.</p>

<p>“But that does you no good.”</p>

<p>“No, but at least it does not snatch you quite away.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
I have learned to hope, Eleutheria. When I was in
the galley-hold all day rowing until my back cracked,
then it seemed as though I could never be glad again.
But I am glad; thanks to you. In the same way I shall
hope that some glorious fate will bring you to me,
though so far from me now. I shall make you love me.”</p>

<p>“But I do not love you,” said Theria desperately,
“and you must not come here any more. This window
is my solitude. You shall not come to it.”</p>

<p>“Do not say that,” he pleaded. “You cannot imagine
the joy it is to come. I have worn a path on the
hillside coming, coming to you. And as I come my
heart lifts and lifts as with a dawning light. Ah, you
do not understand it; nor did I, dear child. It is
something stronger than I—than you—— Each morning,”
he hurried on, fearful lest she leave him, “when
I awake and remember that I am free, then your cry
comes back to me that you are shut in always, always,
without hope. My heart breaks. I, too, had been
shut in without hope. Therefore, I long to free you.”</p>

<p>“You compare me to a slave,” she said sternly.</p>

<p>“No, no,” he cried. “If I could only take your hand
and show you the beautiful temples of the gods, the
cities which I know, the sea. Lady, have you ever seen
the sea?”</p>

<p>“No,” she answered, very low.</p>

<p>“Once I had a friend. He was taken prisoner with
me on the pirate ship. But he died of the wounds he
got shielding me—and I still love him. I thought I
could never love any one in all my life as I love him;
but you, dear maid, you are more than that friend. It
is strange to say that. But you are my friend and my
life. I am no longer my own.” His voice changed
with awe. “Dear lady, it is not Aphrodite’s passion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
that is come upon me, it is the gift of some god loftier
than she—perhaps Eros the Creator. Try to understand.”</p>

<p>Just here the moon sailed clear of the housetops over
the way and filled the narrow lane with light. She
could see him standing there, his head thrown back to
see her—his golden hair bound and crowned. His very
standing was elastic, spurning the ground. So much
had his few weeks of gymnastic restored to him of
Hellenic health and attitude.</p>

<p>She could see the curious, searching light in his face—a
light of tenderness such as she had never known but
which she recognized as all maidens do. Oh, why did
her heart leap? Was she, too, in the power of a god?</p>

<p>Now he startled her yet more.</p>

<p>“Dear lady, I am coming to this house to-morrow
night, I am Nikander’s guest.”</p>

<p>Delphians, though proud as Olympians, were yet the
most cosmopolitan of Greeks. They were taught by
the Oracle to receive all men hospitably.</p>

<p>Theria’s dread increased. What would her father
think? What might not this strange youth tell!</p>

<p>“I shall ask to hear that song,” added the youth.
“The prize song which you made for Dryas, your
brother.”</p>

<p>“I made no song,” she asserted, loyal to her house.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, you did. All the Precinct whispers that.
But I shall know, dear maid, whether the song be yours.
If it came from your spirit, it will go to mine.”</p>

<p>Steps were heard in the lane. She cried out a low
warning. Her anger swept back again that the youth
should thus bring her into fear. But he was gone almost
before her cry. He was among the hills.</p>

<p>Theria turned, dazed, from the window. There on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
the moon-lit floor lay flowers strewn, one bunch upon
another—faded ferns, fresh anemones, violets half dry.
Evidently a gift for every day. If the youth came in
this fashion sooner or later someone would see him.
They would punish her. Worse! They would laugh
at her. A street song, a vulgar old catch, struck across
her mind, one of the common gibes at women:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent2">Always as of old——</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They roast their barley sitting as of old</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They on their heads bear burdens as of old—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They buy themselves sly dainties as of old—</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">They still secrete their lovers as of old.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Ahai! so she had thought herself different, better!
She was like all other silly women. No wonder the men
gibed. Only for a moment had she been guilty, but it
was such a vivid, unforgettable moment. The moon
had shone so bright upon him, the youth had looked so
impossibly beautiful. Fool! The youth was plainly
mad. Never would she allow herself to see him again.</p>

<p>Wrathfully she gathered all the flowers at one sweep
and flung them far out of the window. Theria had
heard of physical love. She had heard of no other kind.
How was she to understand this sudden placing of her
upon a pedestal? How should she guess that the youth
through the suffering of slavery, through the purity of
his gratitude, had stumbled upon an emotion old as
creation, beautiful as dawn, strong as life, which the
Greeks had utterly quenched and set aside?</p>

<p>Next day, sure enough, a feast was preparing in the
house. Theria watched fearfully. Was the Argive
really coming among the other guests? She tried to
keep out of her father’s way, but she had to face him at
luncheon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span></p>

<p>Nikander, where his family was concerned, was very
frank and childlike. “Well, Theria,” he said, “what do
you suppose has happened? A young man comes
asking for your hand.” Theria’s heart thumped so
that she had to stop eating.</p>

<p>“His name is Eëtíon.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> He is from Argos, one of the
handsomest youths I ever saw. What do you think of
that, Daughter?”</p>

<div class="footnotes">
<div class="footnote">
<p><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="label">[2]</a> Note: pronounced A-e-teé-on.</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>“I do not know,” she managed to falter.</p>

<p>“My dear, why tremble?” smiled her father. “The
youth does not concern you. But the fellow is curiously
headlong. Of course I did not discuss dower with him.
But he offered it. He said: ‘I want no dower. I have
seen your daughter in a festival procession. Her beauty
is enough without dower!’ Now in what procession
could he have noticed you, Theria? I do not quite like
it that he should have seen you.”</p>

<p>“I do not know,” she said, again bowing her head.
She was in mortal fear lest he see her fear. But he
turned to Melantho—</p>

<p>“By Hermes, Melantho, I do like the youth. He
quitted Argos because he is too loyal a Hellene to stay
there. I like that. Timon knew the young man’s
father, says the family is one of the most upright in
Argos. The boy shows his race. Beautiful fellow,
astonishingly beautiful.” (The Greek could not but
dwell on beauty whenever he met it.) “The children
of such a youth would be glorious children.”</p>

<p>“But, Father, must I—must I marry an Argive?”</p>

<p>Nikander threw back his head with laughter. It had
been weeks since Theria had heard him laugh.</p>

<p>“No, Theria, your children would be glorious, but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
they would not be legitimate. Eëtíon has purchased
citizenship in Delphi, but he is still metic, a foreigner.
Of course, you will not marry him.”</p>

<p>Nikander voiced the pride that was in every Greek
citizen—the pride and the isolation. No man could
take full citizenship in a city not his own. No marriage
with a foreigner (born say fifty miles distant) was
counted legal by any government. This fact, instinctive
in Theria’s mind, had steeled her heart against the
Argive. Oh, what right had he to come to the house
even as her father’s guest? She dared not object. She
was not supposed to know of his coming.</p>

<p>The dinner guests assembled early. Theria and her
mother had their supper upstairs. Then Theria went
off to bed so as not to hear anything of the feast. But
she could not sleep. She did not want the youth to
hear her song. She tossed and tossed on her hot couch.
What must they be doing now at the feast? Talking of
the war? Ah, yes, that surely. They would not be
singing songs in these war-troubled days, even at
symposia. If she had only dared to ask Dryas not to
sing. But was he singing? Oh, if she only knew.</p>

<p>Impatiently she rose and crept to her father’s room.
Here came up the mingled voices and laughter from the
men’s court. Oh, what was that? Why were they suddenly
silent? That lyre, tuning. Then clear and fateful
came the sound of Dryas’s singing,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Fair, fair on the mountain the feet of Apollo striding.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>The thing always thrilled her; so intimately hers. “I
shall know, dear maid, whether the song be yours. If it
came from your heart it will go to mine.” The Argive’s
saying was ringing back upon her. He was down
there now, listening, close to the singer. Almost<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
she could see the listening in his face. And oh,
the song was giving him what she did not want to
give—her intimate, sweetest thought. He would grasp
it all. Had he not asserted that he would?</p>

<p>She clapped hands upon her ears and fairly ran back
to her room. He had no right, that Argive foreigner,
to read her soul that way. No right!</p>

<p>She lay in her bed trembling. It was long before
she could reason with herself and believe that this was a
foolish, childish fear.</p>

<span class="smaller">LOVE IN THE LANE</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Theria</span> paced to and fro in the large upper
room, weaving. She had unskilful hands for
this craft also as well as for spinning. Her figures
of gods were stiff, her colours never true. But these
days the long task was grateful. The whole household
seemed hushed, as before a storm. Even Melantho
now knew how near the Persians were. She, too, must
be told. “Last week they were at Pydna, to-day we hear
they have reached Larissa in Thessaly.” So the vast
armies approached nearer, nearer, fateful, certain,
awful, and the tiny land toward which they came seemed
crouching with arms upheld to ward off a blow.</p>

<p>But Melantho was unexpectedly quiet. She had
taken charge of the house as never before. And there
was need. The slaves were irritable with fear, disobedient.
This morning Olen had run away.</p>

<p>As for the Argive youth, Theria had not seen him since
the night of Dryas’s singing. She had forsworn her
beloved window. Better so than to see him again.
That one moment of piercing beauty in his face. Ah,
that had taught her the danger. Tender-conscienced
child that she was—she was remorseful for every
moment that she had lingered at the window listening
to his speech. Those moments were not worthy of
Nikander’s daughter. One day she went into the storeroom
to fetch a book-roll which she had left there.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
The floor again was strewn with flowers, faded and
dewy fresh, as though thrown there each day.</p>

<p>That the Argive youth should keep coming. This
haunted her. Patient, persistent, each evening, lonely
in the lane. How was she to drive him from her
thoughts?</p>

<p>She looked up from her weaving. Her father had
opened the curtain of the doorway. He came toward
her. There was in his face a finality which brought her
to her feet.</p>

<p>“Father! The Persians!”</p>

<p>“No, child,” answered Nikander’s low voice. “The
delegation of Athenians is in Delphi.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Father, I knew that.”</p>

<p>“They have received their answer from the Oracle.
Child, the message needed no interpreting priest. It was
fearful and fearfully clear. The Pythia in her own voice,
in ecstasy upon the tripod, warned them out of the
shrine. ‘Quit Athens,’ was her cry. ‘Flee afar; fire
and sword shall come upon your city—and not yours
only, but many cities. My temple sweats blood; get ye
away from my holy place; and steep your souls in
sorrow.’”</p>

<p>“Father, how dreadful; horrible!”</p>

<p>“The priests, of course, are horror-struck. But they
are triumphant, too. They have prevailed over me.
The Athenians! Theria, the Athenians dare not go
home with that message. We have told them, Timon
and I, not to go home with it. That message would
put their armies to rout before the Persians should
strike one blow.”</p>

<p>He stopped. His face took on a deep regret, almost
abhorrence. Then he said hurriedly:</p>

<p>“Theria, I have come to make you the Pythia. It is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
a last resort. You say you can pray. God grant you
can! Oh, my child, put into this consecration every
effort, every spiritual strength you know!”</p>

<p>She was so dazed that she could only stand before
him trying to say “Yes.”</p>

<p>“You will leave the house early to-morrow morning.
You will have your days of rites and preparation. But
the Athenians will await your days. We will enter the
Precinct as supplicants—you and I. The Athenians
also as supplicants. Supplication may win the god.”</p>

<p>He put his hands on her shoulders, gazing deeply into
her eyes. But his mind was far away, wrapt in the
purpose for his state.</p>

<p>“Theria, the honour of the Oracle, the very saving
of Athens and of all Hellas are in your hands. Pray,
pray!”</p>

<p>At the door he paused again with bent head. “You
will have your wish now to stay a virgin. And you can
never come home again.”</p>

<p>She was alone. It is in such moments that one grows
old. Maturity is not of years but of such experience.
She was neither happy nor sad. What she had desired
so long seemed strangely impossible now that it had
come to her. There was no exaltation for the great task.</p>

<p>She kept naming the task over to herself. “I am
to win the good oracle which will save Athens. Apollo
will give me a good answer if I supplicate.” But she
felt very dazed.</p>

<p>Now she laid aside her hated weaving. It was the
last time. The Pythia did not weave. Greater tasks
were hers. Theria’s home which had seemed so prison-like,
that, too, she was leaving for ever. Very quietly she
walked along the balcony to her own room and there
stood thinking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span></p>

<p>How distant her father had seemed. The great state-sorrow
weighed him down. He was beyond thought
of her. Yet there had been something tragic in his
face as though he were laying her as victim upon the
altar rather than lifting her to the tripod.</p>

<p>A fearful thing that tripod. It stood in a dark
cavern, and the breath of the god rushed up from a gulf
below and filled her who was set there. How would
it feel—that breath upon her? What would it do to her,
that ghostly thing? She shook her shoulders as if to
free them of a load.</p>

<p>Oh, dear Paian, what if it did harm her? That was
nothing, nothing! Could she win the good message?
Could she by prayers, importunity, and ritual-supplication
win from the god the better fate for Greece?
Apollo had already given forth the terror and warning.
Could she push that evil back as with her two hands?</p>

<p>All the courage, the confidence, which had so easily
been hers sank out of her. Her heart, which had been
like a pool reflecting the sky of the god, was suddenly
empty. She longed to go to her mother to hide in her
arms. But Melantho (how well she knew) would only
weep and add weakness to her own. Her father? It
had been her father’s detachment, his way of laying the
task impersonally upon her, forgetting the daughter
upon whom he laid it—it was this that made her lonely.
She thought of Dryas, of Lycophron, of Baltè. She
could only hide her face in her hands, rejecting the
thought of each. And the black loneliness grew at each
rejection.</p>

<p>“Is there someone else? Isn’t there any one else?”
she thought wildly.</p>

<p>And like answer to her thought came the clear picture
to her closed eyes. The Argive standing in the moon-lit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
lane with face upturned to hers. “Can you stop the
stream of Castaly? Even so will my love refresh you
whether you will or not.”</p>

<p>She lifted up her face timidly in the empty room. Ah,
he had loved her. He had come again and again with
his love. So faithful, so patient, and how true he was to
Greece! How ready to fight for Hellas! If she should
go to the window to-night, would he give her strength—strength
for her fearful duty? But how could he?
Would he reach up his hands? What could he say?</p>

<p>Suddenly she was trembling so that she had to sit
down, clasping her hands, unclasping them again. How
could he do anything except to put arms about her as
she had longed for her mother to do? But these arms
as they stole about her spirit were not like Melantho’s.
They thrilled her, brought her near to weeping. They
were the arms of love, the love he had told of, the love
that understood the inmost of her heart. She began
to long so intensely for their comforting that she was
frightened. The barriers of her coldness went down at
once, leaving her as tender as young spring. Unconsciously
she reached out her hands in the dim room.</p>

<p>Then a panic assailed her. Perhaps he would not
come. Perhaps her long refusal had broken even his
faithfulness. Perhaps he would fail her for just this
one evening. Then it would be too late. To-morrow
she would be locked in the Pythia House. Then even to
see him would be sin.</p>

<p>To-night! Oh, could she go down into the lane and
greet him there? But how? The house wall was too
high for her down-clambering or for his ascent. The
front door was guarded by Medon.</p>

<p>She would ask Baltè to take her. Surely on this her
last night at home Baltè would be kind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile the news of Theria’s departure was noised
through the house. Melantho was excited, bewildered,
frightened. She was closeted with Nikander. The
slaves were weeping. One after another stole to Theria’s
door, the men awkward in their grief, the women and
girls throwing their arms about their little mistress in
stress of tears.</p>

<p>Theria waited till nightfall before she asked Baltè.</p>

<p>“Just to go out into the lane a little while, Baltè—to
stand near the stream.” Baltè sometimes had taken
her there. But always of a morning when Baltè was
doing her washing.</p>

<p>“Not in the evening, little mistress. You know your
mother would not allow it.”</p>

<p>“She will not care this time. Oh, Baltè, you will have
no more chances to please me!”</p>

<p>“But surely I am going to be with you in the Pythia
House, little mistress?” cried Baltè, frightened.</p>

<p>“There, Baltè, don’t cry. Of course you will.”</p>

<p>But Baltè had already consented to her little mistress’s
wish.</p>

<p>The two entered the lane at nightfall, climbed the
short steep path beside the stream to the very wall of
the cliff.</p>

<p>“But, Missy, I should think you would rather stay
down near the highroad where you could glimpse the
folk passing.”</p>

<p>“Not to-night, Baltè. It is only the air I want and to
be still, very still.”</p>

<p>She slipped into a cleft of the hillside and drew Baltè
with her. How quiet it was. A cricket chirped above
her on the hillside, lonely in the stillness. At the opening
of the lane the highroad was half hidden by the
rocks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span></p>

<p>“Missy, it’s growing late. We mustn’t stay too
long.”</p>

<p>“Oh Baltè, wait—wait.”</p>

<p>Never in her life had Theria known fear such as this—the
fear of the Argive’s not coming. It choked her. It
tasted bitter in her mouth. But why should he come?
Oh, why should he, to her who had been only cruel, who
had thrown only contempt from her window—that
window which now stared at her dimly at a distance
like some vacant fate——</p>

<p>What was that? Oh, Paian, a stir in the bushes above
her, a form in the dusk that walked swiftly and stopped
under her window. Ah, dear gods, how intently he gazed
up where he thought to find her!</p>

<p>She slipped from Baltè’s hand and sped like a freed
bird toward him. Lightly she touched his arm. She
could not speak.</p>

<p>He wheeled—saw her.</p>

<p>“Gods in Olympos! My lady!”</p>

<p>The Argive’s hope had been largely boasting. He had
never imagined a thing like this that she should greet
him in the lane. Now he saw her changed face. His
voice broke with tenderness.</p>

<p>“Eleutheria,” he whispered. Her timid hand reached
toward him.</p>

<p>Then the arms that she had dreamed of were about
her, wonderful, amazing in their love. She had not
known they would tremble. She had not known they
would seem so strong. All thought for winning courage
for her duty left her—all thought of asking anything.
She only longed to give him the gentleness and affection
she had so long denied him. She lifted her hand,
touching his cheek. It was wet with tears.</p>

<p>“I have been unkind. Oh, I have been cruel to you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span></p>

<p>“Never cruel,” he said. “Only a child whom the
gods must teach.”</p>

<p>“They have taught me. They have taught me,” she
answered.</p>

<p>But now Baltè recovered from amazement, and was
shaking Theria’s arm.</p>

<p>“Oh, Missy, Missy, come back with Baltè. Wicked
child, you deceived me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, Baltè,” she said, tender even toward her
old nurse, “I will come. Eëtíon will not harm me. He
is good, good.”</p>

<p>At this confession of faith the youth kissed her afresh.</p>

<p>But Baltè was not to be baulked. “Missy, please,
please, for Apollo’s sake,” she cried, again shaking
Theria. “How can you, you who are to be Pythia
to-morrow?”</p>

<p>“Pythia,” repeated the lover. “What does she mean?
Theria, that is not true!”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am to pray for a good oracle from the god.
Oh, Eëtíon, I feel now that it may be granted me.”</p>

<p>“But you! Great Hermes, you cannot be Pythia.
Your father will not allow that!”</p>

<p>“But Father commands it. He says it is the only
hope of saving the Athenians. I must do it!”</p>

<p>“Theria, no, no!” he said wildly. The horror of the
thing broke over him and the horror of her being torn
from him, for ever beyond his reach. “What a frightful
mistake. Nikander should know better. You are not
fit for a Pythia. The tripod will kill you. It will destroy
your mind. Theria, you must listen to me!”</p>

<p>She was listening indeed. His misery was sweeping
down her high mission as the gale sweeps down the
grain. She clung to him, saying no word.</p>

<p>“I can take you away from it. Oh, it is a horrible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
fate. My darling, for the god’s sake let me save you.
I’ll take you to the islands. No one will find you; no
one.” He was drawing her toward the hill.</p>

<p>That moment her spirit returned to her.</p>

<p>“No, no, Eëtíon. You cannot save me that way. Oh,
you know you cannot!”</p>

<p>His hands dropped to his sides, his head drooped.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he faltered. “Not that way, but how, how?
You must not be Pythia. You are not fit for pythiahood.
I have seen the present Pythia—pale, weak, and
above all, empty, ignorant. Oh, darling Theria, you
cannot be made like that! I must save you!”</p>

<p>“You <em>have</em> saved me,” she said, childlike. “I was
afraid and you have made me unafraid. Because you
love me, just because you love me. Oh, Eëtíon. Death
lies both ways. For the Persians will kill us if they get
into Hellas. Only the god can keep them back. I
must pray to the god. I must pray to the god. I know
he will hear me. Must I not go when I know that?
Oh, Eëtíon, help me—help me to go!”</p>

<p>He took her face between his hands, gazing into the
brave depths of her eyes.</p>

<p>“Always you make me remember that you are
Eleutheria,” he said in a low, awed voice. “If you were
like other women I could not so love you—oh, do you
believe how I love you—love you?”</p>

<p>Then before she could answer—</p>

<p>“Go,” he said hastily. “While I can let you go.”</p>

<p>She bowed her head and started down the lane. But
he caught her back with passionate kisses. He knew
it was the last time. There in the narrow lane pure
love, neglected and chilled by Greek custom and unknown
to Greek sullying passion, burned high and clear
like an altar flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span></p>

<p>Baltè was beside herself with fear. Yet if she gave
the alarm what a punishment there would be for her
darling! Only the dread Cyprian could know when they
would have parted had not a step echoed from the
highway and Medon’s deaf-hollow voice called:</p>

<p>“Baltè, ye fool. If ye don’t come in I’ll lock the door
on ye. What time is this to be stayin’ out in the night
with the little mistress?”</p>

<p>And at this Baltè gathered her nurseling in her arms
and almost carried her into the house.</p>

<span class="smaller">A PROCESSION OF SACRIFICE</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Next</span> morning it was Nikander himself who
came to awaken his daughter. The house was
full of the bustle and awe of the departure. The
dawn was yet grey. Melantho brought a white festal
robe and for one long hour she and Baltè dressed the
young candidate, pinning the robe at the shoulders,
clasping the girdle, drawing the soft fabric up through
it, full over the breast, then adjusting the long straight
folds to the sandalled feet.</p>

<p>Melantho brought the casket of jewels.</p>

<p>“Where are the pearls?” she complained. “You
should have the pearls to-day.”</p>

<p>Theria put her deft fingers among the jewels, stirring
their glitter.</p>

<p>“Please leave me without jewels, Mother,” she said
quietly. Then she added, “Oh, Mother, let me give
them to the god. Apollo loves gifts. He says if one
gives one’s all it is as great as the bowl of Crœsos. These
are my all. Perhaps they will help.”</p>

<p>So they crowned her with red roses and hung a great
garland of roses about her neck. Baltè thought she had
never seen any one so beautiful as her dark-eyed darling.</p>

<p>But Nikander, coming to look at her, was touched
with anxiety.</p>

<p>“Daughter,” he questioned, “your hope is yet strong
in you? Do you feel that you can reach the god?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, Father, I was never so sure as to-day,” she
answered him.</p>

<p>He took Baltè aside.</p>

<p>“What is it? Her eyes?” he asked anxiously. “It is
almost a fatal look. Is she well?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Master,” said Baltè. “But Master must remember
that she is leaving her home. That is awesome
for a maid.”</p>

<p>“No doubt; yes, indeed,” he agreed.</p>

<p>He went to his own room and brought forth a cup of
his most delicate wine.</p>

<p>“I want roses in your cheeks this morning, Theria,”
he said as he gave it to her. But the roses came before
she drank.</p>

<p>For as she took the cup she noted its picture—the
same that was on the cup that she had broken—Athena
bestowing upon a worshipper—the same delicate
sureness of drawing—unmistakable!</p>

<p>“My dear, you are spilling the wine,” admonished
Nikander, steadying her trembling hand.</p>

<p>Slowly she sipped it, bringing herself to speech.</p>

<p>“Father, give me this cup to take with me.”</p>

<p>“You strange child. It is a common thing from the
pottery under the hill.”</p>

<p>“It will be from home,” she faltered.</p>

<p>Nikander went off for reassurance to his Wife. “Will
she be homesick, think you?” he asked.</p>

<p>Left alone, Theria stole away to look at the places
that she must see no more—her father’s room, the
aula, the balcony. She had to walk slowly, stately, in
her robe. Already she seemed far away from the free,
swift-moving Theria she had been. Last of all she came
to the dusky old storeroom. Here, strangely enough, it
was not its recent memories that came to her, but the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
memory of that far-off day when she had wept there as
a child and had seen the nymphs and baby Hermes
in the stream.</p>

<p>Then suddenly the sharp scent of violets met her—sweet,
dewy, fresh, new. With a low cry she gathered
the flowers from the floor; then, stumbling over her
long robe, she hurried from the room.</p>

<p>The Nikander family left the house in silent procession.
They were all crowned with laurel and carried
with them the necessary things of sacrifice—the flat
baskets with grain of barley, the torch lighted from
their own dear hearth. Lycophron led the victim, a
white goat whose gilded horns were crowned with
flowers.</p>

<p>It was a solemn going. Theria had never thought
that she could walk toward her beloved Precinct with so
heavy a heart. A breeze, rare in summer, caught her
festal skirts and fluttered them about her. Across the
sky raced splendid clouds whose huge silver bulks but
made loftier the blue sky-spaces between them. Midsummer
had laid its silence on the morning birds but
doves on her cousin Clitè’s roof cooed and strutted in
the sunshine.</p>

<p>And now they had reached the Precinct. How easily
the great gates opened to her this time. Did the keeper
remember that other morning, she wondered? When
he had refused to let her in?</p>

<p>“Father, who are those splendid-looking men?”
she asked. “They seem waiting for us.”</p>

<p>“They are waiting, indeed. They are the Athenians.”</p>

<p>Theria’s heart rose at the sight of them. At sight of
their anxious faces her personal sorrow retired before
their larger sorrow. She wanted to call out to them, to
tell them how sure was her hope. But of course she<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span>
could do no such thing. The Athenians greeted her
father solemnly from a distance.</p>

<p>Now the priests gave into all their hands great boughs
of trees.</p>

<p>“Do not speak again, Daughter,” said Nikander.
“We are suppliants now.”</p>

<p>And bearing their solemn boughs with which to constrain
the god and with their baskets, their torch, and
their slow-moving victim, they went up the Sacred Way.
The Athenians went with them. Kindly the little
temples watched them go, kindly the gods and heroes beside
the way.</p>

<p>Before the great altar in front of Apollo’s temple they
stopped. The altar was alight, smoking in the sunshine.
The flute player began a slow Dorian melody.
The priest brought a great silver bowl of water and,
lighting a new torch at the altar flame, plunged it hissing
into the bowl. With the water thus sanctified, he
sprinkled the worshippers. Then lifting the bowl high
with the swift gesture of long custom, he dashed the
water full upon the goat. It shivered in all its limbs!</p>

<p>Good omens, good omens all. Theria’s confidence
soared upward with her simple faith.</p>

<p>When the goat was sacrificed, Theria was sure that
its outgoing life was mounting invisibly to please the
Son of Leto. In her enthusiasm, she kissed her hands to
the god and stood so with her arms uplifted. Nikander,
gazing upon her, felt more hopeful than for many weeks.</p>

<p>When the ritual was done, they laid the supplicant
boughs upon the altar. Her brother and her mother
kissed Theria good-bye, a sorrowful parting but quiet as
befitted the temple place. Then Nikander took Theria’s
hand and, Baltè following, led her around the back of the
Great Temple to the Pythia House.</p>

<span class="smaller">IN THE PYTHIA HOUSE</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> old house-mistress received them; a stubby
little person, most proper and severe, who fixed
her eyes upon Theria intently and disapprovingly.
As she let them in, a curious suffering sound came from
a farther room.</p>

<p>“It’s Aristonikè, the Pythia,” vouchsafed the mistress.
“She has been like that ever since her last oracle—the
one to the Athenians. She stands it worse and worse,
poor child. It’s good we’re getting another to help her.”</p>

<p>Again she looked Theria up and down.</p>

<p>“Your slave woman can come with me,” she said,
referring to Baltè. “Wait you for me there.”</p>

<p>She was one of those old servants whose trustiness
and efficiency are so great as hardly to be borne by
those who employ them.</p>

<p>Nikander and Theria were left in the little room,
unknowing for how long. Beyond the corridor the
poor little Pythoness kept up her incessant moaning.</p>

<p>It did not frighten Theria. From her stronghold of
perfect health she could not think of herself as being
thus laid low, but it filled Nikander with horror. He
was glad when Theria began to speak.</p>

<p>“Father, the Athenians look so bitterly anxious. Is
their task the hardest of all? Harder than that of the
Spartans?”</p>

<p>“I think so, child.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span></p>

<p>“But why?”</p>

<p>“Because they are not only doing their own task but
keeping the Spartans to theirs. Then, too, Athens city
itself is almost sure to be destroyed.”</p>

<p>“Father!”</p>

<p>Theria leaned forward in her usual absorbed fashion.
Nikander suddenly realized how he would miss Theria’s
questionings at home. Of late, he had actually cleared
his plans by talking fully to Theria. This he did not
acknowledge even to himself. Yet it affected his mood.
He was tenderly frank in speech with her.</p>

<p>“Athens destroyed!” she repeated.</p>

<p>“It will all depend upon the battle in the north. The
battle which we hope will bar the Persians out of
Greece. We have decided now to hold them back at a
place called Thermopylæ, the narrowest pass anywhere
in our northern mountain barrier. The pass
lies thus,” he gestured, “between steep mountain and
sea. It is scarce six feet wide.”</p>

<p>“How far from here?” she queried.</p>

<p>“Seventy-five miles by mountain road. The Spartans,
we hope, will march thither. The Athenians’ ships
will hold the strait at Artemesium. Land and sea will
fight at once.”</p>

<p>“But if we win,” exclaimed Theria, “then Athens will
be safe!”</p>

<p>“Yes, if we win,” he repeated. “If we lose, the
Persians will march direct upon Athens and upon us.”</p>

<p>“Oh, could the Athenians do nothing? Nothing?”</p>

<p>“Nothing to save their city, my child. Even Themistocles
says that in that case the citizens must flee to
the isle of Salamis.” Nikander was by this time lost
in the subject uppermost in his heart. “But the
Athenian fleet would fight. They are very confident<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
of their fleet in Salamis Bay. They can tempt the
Persians into the small bay where skill will count more
than numbers. The crowding of the Persian ships
might—— But, child, why do I tell you this? I have
the habit of it because you never tell what is told you.
But this is most seriously secret.”</p>

<p>“And you know I will keep it so,” she said with a little
dignified uplift of her head which gave him a sudden
pleasure and pride. Silence fell between them. They
sat impatiently waiting, the courage of one of them
oozing fast. They could hear again the moaning of the
Pythia with now and then a miserable, delirious scream.</p>

<p>At last the old house mistress appeared.</p>

<p>“You are to come with me,” she said to Theria.</p>

<p>Nikander rose and took his daughter’s hand for good-bye.
But as he kissed her a bitter tumult seized him.
He hid his face in his cloak and hurried from the room.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE CHILD PRIESTESS</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Theria’s</span> room was small, hardly more than
a closet. Like all Greek bedrooms, it was
windowless, but opened on a sunny court.</p>

<p>She was glad to be alone. The coming three days
seemed hardly enough for her prayers and importunities
to her god. The Athenian danger possessed her. She
felt inspired and strong. She stood in the middle of the
room lifting her hands. They almost touched the low
ceiling.</p>

<p>“O Paian, dear Son of Leto. Am I not thy supplicant?
A supplicant thou canst not refuse? Have
I not given all my jewels, Apollon, Apollon? If I had
more I would give all to thee.”</p>

<p>Here the old house mistress entered without prelude.</p>

<p>“You are to take off that gown,” she said, “and put on
this, the simple garb of the Pythia.”</p>

<p>She held forth a sort of long shift. It was fine-fluted
in the ancient fashion and yellow, the accepted colour
of the Apollo priesthood.</p>

<p>“Send me my tiring woman,” said Theria.</p>

<p>“Your tiring woman is gone home. You will have
the usual temple slave. The Pythia has no touch with
outside folk.”</p>

<p>“Baltè is not outside folk. I will refrain from all
speech with her, if that is the rule, nor will I allow her to
speak.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span></p>

<p>“That makes no difference,” said the old peasant woman,
joying in her authority. “It is against the law.”</p>

<p>Theria’s heart bounded with anger.</p>

<p>“How dare you mistrust me, woman? Have I not
the good of the oracle at heart more than you? Go at
once and fetch me Baltè.”</p>

<p>The house mistress bowed and went out. And
presently the Pythian slave appeared, very timid, and
eyeing her, secretly amused.</p>

<p>Theria looked hard at her.</p>

<p>“Go out,” she commanded. “How dare you enter
my room when I have not sent for you?”</p>

<p>The woman withdrew but Theria was conscious that
she lingered in the court.</p>

<p>Never in all her life had any one dressed Theria but
Baltè. It was quite unthinkable that any one else
should do it. Theria was a spoiled child in this.</p>

<p>Awkwardly she unpinned her white robe herself,
folded it away, and donned her Pythia habit.</p>

<p>But anger is the arch destroyer of prayer. Theria
could not pray now. Besides, she was mortally
hungry.</p>

<p>In her excitement last night she had eaten almost
nothing. Now she must fast for three days to come.</p>

<p>She supposed, of course, that the hunger would grow
worse and worse. She walked up and down the room
when she should have remained still, saving her
strength.</p>

<p>“What do I care for hunger?” she kept saying
proudly. “For mere hunger when Athens is in danger
of burning!”</p>

<p>But it was only by an effort that she could hold her
mind on Athens. Her thoughts kept rising, floating
away like clouds.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span></p>

<p>Eëtíon, where was he to-day? Somewhere in the
Precinct? Was he thinking of her? Surely of naught
else. Word after word of his came flashing back to her,
snatching her breath with joy. Now his very touch, his
trembling kindness filled her with a new and terrible
longing. Only one dear hour of love in all her long life
would she ever have to treasure and remember.</p>

<p>Suddenly with a wrench she brought her thoughts
back to the present.</p>

<p>“Love of Leto, how the poor little Pythia moaned
in her room across the court.”</p>

<p>It was impossible for Theria to be near suffering and
not try to help.</p>

<p>She hurried across the court and entered the room.
Aristonikè lay upon a couch, her eyes staring and bright.
She was thin as a blade of grass, looked a mere child with
her poor little cheekbones so prominent and white and
her tiny chin so pointed. Theria came and stroked the
pathetic face.</p>

<p>“Poor little Aristonikè, poor little girl,” she said.</p>

<p>The wandering eyes fixed themselves upon her.</p>

<p>“Who?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“I am Theria, daughter of Nikander. Where is your
pain, dear child?”</p>

<p>“Not anywhere—all over.”</p>

<p>“Are you hungry?” asked Theria. This thought
was so present with herself.</p>

<p>“Aach,” said the little creature, turning with disgust.</p>

<p>The slave who sat at the bedside answered for her.</p>

<p>“She will not eat these many days, Mistress; and
she never sleeps, never, after an oracle.”</p>

<p>Theria gave a low-toned order to the slave, who presently
brought hot milk. To Theria in her hunger it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
smelt like nectar itself. Aristonikè at sight of it hid her
eyes.</p>

<p>“But if you will take it,” pleaded Theria, “I will
send out your slave to buy a little living bird for you, a
linnet in a cage.”</p>

<p>Aristonikè uncovered her eyes. “Will it sing?”</p>

<p>“Ah, how it will sing! high and low and chittery. But
you must awake early in the morning for then it will
sing best.”</p>

<p>As Theria talked she fed her the milk and Aristonikè
sipped it before she knew.</p>

<p>They were still at this when the old dame Tuchè
appeared.</p>

<p>“Mistress Theria here! What are you doing in this
room?”</p>

<p>“You see what I am doing!” Theria answered.</p>

<p>“You are to keep your own room. I supposed you
knew that.”</p>

<p>Theria rose in alarm.</p>

<p>“Have I broken the ritual? Oh, I hope I have not
broken it.”</p>

<p>Aristonikè began to moan again.</p>

<p>“Do not go, oh, lady, do not go.”</p>

<p>She caught Theria’s dress, clinging to it as with little
claws.</p>

<p>“I did not think the god would mind,” spoke Theria
anxiously. “Is it not for his priestess to heal if she
can?”</p>

<p>Old Tuchè’s armour was not without its flaw. She
loved the little priestess child. She gazed at Aristonikè
and her face curiously changed as if some sweet were
trying to mitigate its sour.</p>

<p>“Well, mayhap ye can stay, Mistress Theria,” she
grudgingly consented. “I don’t say it’s not irregular.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span>
But, well, it’s to-morrow an’ next day for your silence.
Is the child eatin’?”</p>

<p>“When you stopped her she was eating,” Theria
made answer.</p>

<p>So Theria stayed. Aristonikè gazed at her, and slow
tears began to pour down sideways from eyes upon her
pillow.</p>

<p>“What use is it to be better?” she said fatally.
“Whenever I am better they come again and, oh, they
put me in the smoke and then it begins.”</p>

<p>“What begins?” questioned Theria.</p>

<p>“Oh, the ecstasy of the tripod,” she whispered,
frightened.</p>

<p>“But, Aristonikè, I am Pythia, too. Did you not
know that? I am going to the tripod in your stead.
Then you will grow well.”</p>

<p>Again the little claws caught at her, but in a sort of
protection.</p>

<p>“No, no, not you!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Theria, nodding confidently. “I am
strong. Me it will not hurt. Think not of the tripod,
little one. There, there. You will not weep any more.”</p>

<p>And presently beyond hope, the tired little priestess,
with her hands clasped in Theria’s strong ones, fell
asleep.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE HIGH, PERILOUS SEAT</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">When</span> Theria awoke next morning she did not
at first remember where she was. For the
first time in her life she opened her eyes upon a
room not her own. Then she noted over in the corner
a woman dressed in the yellow robe of the temple. As
Theria turned her awakened face the woman solemnly
advanced, holding aloft two golden vessels. She offered
one, a cup of water. Theria knew that this water was
from the sacred spring Cassotis, which bubbled forth
near the temple.</p>

<p>Apollo, himself, had troubled that spring. That was
the reason it bubbled. His touch was upon it still.
Theria drank in fear while the priestess murmured,
“Apollon, Apollon.”</p>

<p>Would the ecstasy fall at once? It sometimes did fall
upon the Pythia after this single draught.</p>

<p>Silence followed while the priestess searched Theria’s
face. Theria paled, knowing well what she searched
for. Then the priestess presented the second vessel,
in which were leaves of laurel.</p>

<p>These Theria was required to chew. How bitter
they tasted, intensely so in her hungry state. She rose
from her couch, swayed as she stood. Without a word
the priestess caught her and nodded her head in satisfaction.
It was the beginning of what the priests
wished for. How strangely Theria’s fingers tingled<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
and, as she stepped, how heavy were her feet. She
tried not to be terrified, but she was a healthy young
thing. She dreaded the supernatural.</p>

<p>The old priestess dressed her.</p>

<p>“You must make sacrifice at the altar now,” she said.</p>

<p>She led Theria out of the house and into the glory
of an amethystine morning. They came out upon the
lofty temple platform and the whole Precinct lay below,
little pillared temples bathing their feet in the low level
rays of light, brazen statues, golden tripods flashing like
struck cymbals in the dawn. The white Sacred Way
was drawn clear as with the swift finger of the god up
zig-zag through his own treasuries.</p>

<p>A trumpet sounded. It cut the pure air, a flashing
shaft of sound; then echoed, echoed from cliff to cliff
into utter clarity and sweetness—a note from Elysium.</p>

<p>Theria stretched forth her hands in enthusiasm of
love. Every vestige of her dizziness disappeared.</p>

<p>“But this way is the altar,” corrected the dame,
and led her to it.</p>

<p>Here Theria performed long rites, offerings of barley
and wine, long silent prayers. Then she was led back
into her room.</p>

<p>“Do not move from here,” said the priestess. “Be
silent. Try to think of—nothing.” So she left her.</p>

<p>Never would Theria forget that day, the interminable
hours, the slow change of the slant sunlight in the court,
the trying to pray, succeeding at last with upsoaring
faith, sleeping; the awakening to realize that it was still
only morning. Then again the waiting, waiting.</p>

<p>The third and last morning Theria was so weak that
she longed to cry, longed as she never supposed she
could long for Baltè to come to her. Baltè surely could
make her well.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span></p>

<p>To-day, as yesterday, she must preserve through all
the hours the holy silence.</p>

<p>Again came the old priestess and dressed her. Then
a procession of priestesses led Theria down to the
Castalian spring where they gave her the sacred, purifying
bath.</p>

<p>The shock of the cold water restored her. She realized
with a start that now, if ever, she must seize the
will of the god. She began to struggle with petitions.
When she entered her room again it seemed to reel
round and round her head. Surely this meant that
Apollo was approaching nearer—nearer. The face of the
god with solemn eyes and wide-flung hair became suddenly
so vivid before her that she could not tell whether
it was an image in her mind or the real presence of the
god. Her home, her father, Eëtíon were all infinitely
far away. Numbly she realized that she was passing
into the ecstatic state.</p>

<p>Once again it was morning—the morning of the
oracle. Theria’s mind awoke crystal clear, drenched
through and through with hope. She smiled so happily
at the old priestess when she came in that the dame
bent and kissed her. Then, since this was against custom,
the woman was quite shocked at what she had
done.</p>

<p>Now the hour of the oracle was come. Dreamily
Theria was conscious of being led into the temple.
Knew that her hair was hanging loose, the sacred veil
and crown upon her head. Ah, the dear, dear temple!
There were the splendid golden eagles, the navel stone,
first of Delphi’s treasures, Pindar’s chair which she had
kissed. And over yonder the Athenian consultants
waiting with awed faces. Oh, the god would help them.
She was sure, now, sure!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span></p>

<p>Suddenly the priestesses kindled to exceeding brightness
the eternal flame on the altar; put into it many
branches of dry laurel. The cella was filled with
smoke, especially the space behind the altar where
within temporary screens the priestesses waved the
half-extinguished laurel branches.</p>

<p>The priests pushed Theria into this enclosure. How
sweet was the smell of the smoke. So smelled the little
altar at home, the—— Oh, it was choking her!</p>

<p>She started forth from the screen. They pushed her
back again. She began to struggle and to gasp—they
held her—oh, fatal consequence! Their roughness
made her angry. Weak as she was she fought them
back. It was almost unknown that the Pythia should
have such strength at this stage of the ritual.</p>

<p>At last they brought her forth, her eyes streaming,
her nose also, her lungs burning as with fire. Down
the rough-hewn steps they led her into the dim holy of
holies. Bed rock was the floor and in its midst the
narrow opening of a cave. Over the blackness of this
abyss stood, solemn, tall, and terrible, the brazen
tripod. From the blackness below would rise the
breath of the god.</p>

<p>In awe-stricken silence the priests and Athenian consultants,
again lifting on high their branches of supplication,
filed into the small dank place. They filled
it quite and ranged themselves with religious care.</p>

<p>Theria saw everything: the golden statue of Apollo,
the special laurel tree in its tub; and there was her
father looking as she had never seen him, his face set,
white as chalk. She must not fail him—all the life of
her dear Hellas hung upon her now.</p>

<p>Great Apollon! Akeretos, the priest-president, was
lifting her up to the high seat of the tripod!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span></p>

<p>Now she must shake the laurel tree. For in the
laurel was the life of the god. Yes, she was shaking it.
The consultants stood waiting, waiting.</p>

<p>Suddenly she had a queer sort of panic. She had
been expecting forgetfulness so intensely for so many
hours. Now instead of forgetfulness everything became
horribly clear—all memories, all thoughts, home,
Eëtíon, nonsense rhymes which Baltè used to sing her.
Great Paian! she must not laugh.... That would
be sacrilege.</p>

<p>And oh, they were waiting, they were shifting their
feet. The Athenians stole glances at each other.
Their eyes were despair. How her father was gazing at
her! Oh, if she could only pray! A moment more and
they would take her down from the tripod.</p>

<p>She had failed!</p>

<p>Flashingly a temptation crossed Theria, a temptation
as old as magic—as old as priestcraft or the first mumbling
worship of primitive man.</p>

<p>She would <em>make</em> the oracle. Make it herself! Better
that than for Athens to go unanswered.</p>

<p>The god! He might strike her with his arrows. Nay,
he would instantly destroy her.... Better that
than let Athens go unanswered!</p>

<p>She stiffened straight as a reed on her tripod and
flung her hands on high, cupping the palms as if to
receive a gift. Never had the Athenians seen anything
more beautiful. Athena, their own virgin goddess,
might in some divine appearing be of this likeness.</p>

<p>And her voice, the intense, meaningful voice of the
singer:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Apollon, Apollon!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Apollon emos.</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Ships, ships—see—see!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span></p>
<p>Oh, how fatally clear she remembered all her father’s
words. All that he had told her of the Athenian policy.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Sails, galleys of the glancing sails. To Salamis,</div>

    <div class="verse indent0">Down—down—down!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She was keen as a hawk. She saw her father start
with horror. He was remembering his inadvertent talk
with her. She must not be too exact, she must not let
him suspect what she was doing. She began to mumble.
Baltè’s nonsense rhymes would do while she was
gathering thought. Her message must not be too
hopeful. Now she had it!</p>

<p>She broke forth into hexameter verse. Once in a
long while the Pythia did this and it was considered
more exact. The priests could not remake it.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pallas cannot prevail to appease great Zeus in Olympos,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>She began to sway, holding her hands still above
her, repeating, “Salamis, thou the divine.” Then mumbling
at nothing.</p>

<p>Surely now the god would strike her. This greatest
of all sins upon her—— He must strike her.</p>

<p>She crouched, as if avoiding a blow.</p>

<p>Then she achieved her one Pythian act: She really
fainted quite away.</p>

<span class="smaller">BITTER CONSEQUENCES</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Day</span> after day Nikander came to the Pythian
House to inquire after his daughter.</p>

<p>“She has recovered,” they told him. “She
eats once more; but there is upon her the apathy that
follows the utterance.”</p>

<p>“What does she do?”</p>

<p>“Gazes for hours at nothing,” was the reply. “The
usual thing. Though it is not usual that the apathy
come so soon. She has gone but once to the tripod.
Aristonikè now, not so strong a girl was she, but she
went many a time under the ecstasy before this apathy
attacked her.”</p>

<p>Nikander went home with heavy heart. He dared
not tell Melantho his anxiety. Melantho’s way was
to increase trouble by bewailing it. And Theria was
but one of his deep anxieties.</p>

<p>His two sons these days seemed to have constant
business in which they gave Nikander no part. This
was natural for Lycophron. He was wild and loose-living.
It would be a sorry day for him if he had to tell
his father all his doings. But of late he and Dryas
had become very intimate. From morning to night
they were together. Even when in other company,
Nikander saw glances pass between them. Lycophron
was the worst possible example for a soft, gentle boy<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_171"></a>[171]</span>
like Dryas. Yet Nikander did not like to break the
brotherly tie. He still loved his eldest son.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, of course, Theria’s ailment was far different
from what Nikander supposed.</p>

<p>It was no exhaustion of nerves from indulging in
trance and supernatural sight. It was agony of mind.</p>

<p>Apollo had not killed her! This was her chief grievance.
The mighty Immortal had allowed her to
contemn his shrine, to deceive his questioners. Yet he
did nothing—and continued to do nothing. What sort
of a god was he?</p>

<p>And the Athenians had gone joyously home with
their oracle. So the old temple dame had told her.
They were treasuring it as the word of the god. They
were acting upon it. The whole city was moved in
effort to understand and fulfil the sacred words,
Theria’s words!</p>

<p>She laughed hysterically.</p>

<p>She could talk to no one of what she had done.
The oracle must remain to help the Athenians as best
it could.</p>

<p>And what of all the oracles, age long, multitudinous,
the pride and wonder of her childhood? Were they all
like this—fraud and deception?</p>

<p>This thought beat down Theria’s spirit as with strokes
of a sledgehammer.</p>

<p>“No—no—no,” she would say aloud.</p>

<p>Those oracles had helped the poor—they had
punished the wrong-doer, they had founded colonies
and controlled states. And surely Aristonikè had
genuinely felt the god-possession. Had it not wrecked
her, body and mind? But the doubt remained, tormenting
all the golden preciousness of all the reverences
of her life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span></p>

<p>The Precinct, the beloved Precinct itself, where men
brought grateful gifts to the god. What a mockery!
Were these wistful worshippers all deceived? Did
Apollo sit in Olympos and <em>laugh</em> at them?</p>

<p>And Theria was wretchedly lonely. Hour-long,
hour-long, with nothing to do, not even spinning. The
home faces, home voices, not a thousand paces distant,
were all to her as far as the pillars of Heracles. Farther—farther!
for it is conceivable that loved ones might return
thence, but her dear ones could not come to her.</p>

<p>And while she sat mid the windowless walls there
happened without her knowledge the most glorious
single deed of Greece.</p>

<p>Sparta was ever grudging. She did not much care
to bar the Persians out of all Greece. She would
have preferred to meet them on the borders of her own
Lakonia. If all her sister states should then perish
why should Sparta care?</p>

<p>But one Spartan cared supremely to keep them out
of Greece. Her king, Leonidas. So Leonidas, with
the few soldiers which the Ephors grudgingly allowed
him, marched for Thermopylæ.</p>

<p>Nikander, Lycophron, Dryas, Eëtíon—all the men of
Delphi—saw one day the file of bronze-clad soldiers
coming up the Delphi road, led by the twinkling flame
of their sacred fire. They came with set faces under
their helmets, their new polished shields glancing in the
sun.</p>

<p>They paused only to do honour to Apollo, then moved
onward up the Parnassian road. Three hundred men
and a few timid allies to meet a million Persians at the
narrow pass!</p>

<p>Those who saw them never forgot them. Nor has the
world forgot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span></p>

<p>But Theria within her walls knew nothing of these
things. Theria had come upon a new dilemma.</p>

<p>The day of oracle came around again. Aristonikè
was too ill for the tripod. Theria must serve again.</p>

<p>Of course she would not deceive again. Indeed she
had no knowledge with which to deceive. Besides,
she had determined that she would never again speak
upon the tripod. She wanted to cry out against it, to
tell the world what a mummery it was. Yet in spite of
all this she was compelled to undergo the preparatory
rites. She had to fast, chew the laurel, pass through
the smoke. When she did not go into the trance, they
tried her over and over again until she was well-nigh
dead.</p>

<p>“I knew she could not do it,” she heard old Tuchè
saying in the court. “What ’mazes me is that she went
under the first time. She’s not the kind for a pythoness.”</p>

<p>Well, then, they would cast her aside, and for Theria
they could not do so too soon. Then her life would be
spent in the Pythia House. She thought of her lover and
of the rich life that might have been hers, even of the
“glorious children” that her father had spoken of.
But now she would be but a useless vessel, cast aside.
Theria had no joy in her helpful Athenian oracle. Her
whole world was overshadowed because her god was
gone.</p>

<p>One evening she was sitting in her room, “gazing into
space” as Tuchè had described it, when the old slave
who had tried to wait on her that first day brought
her her supper. Now Theria had never received this
woman. Tuchè had been obliged to send her a young
girl whom finally, because Theria needed such service,
she accepted. Now why did the old slave come again?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
Doubtless Tuchè had sent her merely as an annoyance.
Tuchè disliked the new Pythoness.</p>

<p>“How dare you come here again?” Theria said to the
old slave. “I will not see you; I——” She rose to her
feet.</p>

<p>But the old slave, trembling much, set aside the
supper tray and threw off her cloak.</p>

<p>“Baltè!” Theria cried, and with outstretched arms
ran to Baltè’s bosom.</p>

<p>“Be quiet! There, there, my darlin’, don’t cry so,
blessèd, blessèd—my little bird!” whispered Baltè,
stroking the dark hair.</p>

<p>And Theria gradually brought herself into control,
but her heart seemed breaking with joy.</p>

<p>“Baltè, Baltè, I never thought I could be so glad
again. I never thought——”</p>

<p>“And just for seein’ old Baltè’s face,” said the slave
proudly. “Here, eat your supper. Ye’re that thin and
white.”</p>

<p>They talked in whispers, or rather in low, even tones,
for Baltè well knew that whispers are most conspicuous
of all sounds.</p>

<p>“How did you get to me, Baltè; how, in Apollo’s
name?” Even the divine name seemed strange to
Theria now.</p>

<p>“Been tryin’ ever since that old Chimera took me
away from you. What’s she, to be takin’ care o’ my
darling?”</p>

<p>“Yes—go on.”</p>

<p>“I couldn’t get in. The slaves were that pitickilar.
Then I went to Lycophron and I begged him. I says,
‘Give me money to get to my darlin’. She’s dyin’ for
the sight of a home face.’</p>

<p>“‘How do you know that?’ says he.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span></p>

<p>“‘You know yourself,’ I says. ‘Could she feel any
other way?’</p>

<p>“Then his eyes grew soft like and he gave me not
silver, but gold.</p>

<p>“‘Bribe ’em, Baltè, and get in,’ says he, laughin’. You
know the way he does. ‘There’s no slave in the world
but will take a bribe. When that’s gone come to me for
more’.”</p>

<p>“Good, dear Lycophron,” said Theria, loving him
tenderly.</p>

<p>She leaned closer. Already her face was changed by
this touch of home. She asked lovingly after father and
mother, even each slave of the household.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Baltè——” she said at last, then stopped.
It was the first time she had ever spoken this name to
any one.</p>

<p>“Did he ever come again—Eëtíon who met me in the
lane?”</p>

<p>“Shame upon you. Do you think I’d be bringin’
you love messages, you, a priestess of Apollo?”</p>

<p>Theria hid her face, shivering.</p>

<p>“No—no. Oh, Baltè, I would not want messages.
How can you think that of me? And I did not mean
to ask.”</p>

<p>Poor child, only her own sense of right would uphold
her now. She had no longer any fear of the god.</p>

<p>When Baltè rose to go Theria threw arms about her.</p>

<p>“You’ll come again. Promise that you’ll come
again.”</p>

<p>“Surely will I. Oh, there, I’m most forgettin’ the
message Lycophron sent you. ‘It’s an oracle,’ says he,
laughin’. ‘I can give oracles as well as any one. You
tell Theria: “Keep up heart. Argos has become Delphi
for her sake.”’ It’s a queer message that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span></p>

<p>“‘Argos has become Delphi,’” she repeated, puzzled.
“Argos, Argos. Could it be the Argive?”</p>

<p>Theria began to laugh softly, her eyes full of tears,
clinging to Baltè and kissing her.</p>

<p>“Darling old Baltè,” she said. “Darling, dear old
Baltè.”</p>

<p>“He said you’d like it,” said the old slave, nodding
her head.</p>

<p>Oh, dangerous message. Lycophron did not look
ahead. He meant to be kind.</p>

<span class="smaller">“PRAY TO THE WINDS”</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Next</span> week happened what Theria most feared:
An important oracle was required. Theria
learned by chance that it was important. Old
Tuchè in her excitement over it forgot how loudly she
was speaking in the court.</p>

<p>“This time an oracle they <em>must</em> have,” she was
asserting. “It is a matter of state. The new Pythoness
can’t get it. I wonder what they’ll do with her,
anyway.”</p>

<p>Theria was in despair. Should she refuse to try?
Feign illness? Then a new pythia would sit upon the
tripod to babble at nothing or to give some dread,
discouraging word. Nikander had placed Theria in
the Pythia House counting upon her prayerful help.
Should she step down and leave him without that help,
or was it her duty to go upon the tripod and feign
again for Hellas’s sake?</p>

<p>But gods in Olympos! she did not know the question
nor who was asking it. She could not deceive if she
would. She would refuse to try.</p>

<p>Upon this decision Theria found relief for her troubled
mind. No more should they starve her and push
her through the smoke. She could rest. She no longer
cared for anything but to be left alone.</p>

<p>That evening, like a light among shadows, came old
Baltè again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span></p>

<p>Theria’s first question concerned her father.</p>

<p>“Master is sad, very sad,” the old nurse told her,
“but so is everyone sad. It’s like a storm gatherin’ on
Parnassos—those Persians coming. And everybody is
afraid like as when they hear thunder and the darkness
comes closer. Oh, darlin’, if I could take you out of
this house and keep you in the fastness of the mountain.
There it will be safe. Only there.”</p>

<p>Again the danger brought to Theria its dark and
solemn peace.</p>

<p>“Poor Baltè,” she said. “How could I live in the
mountain with Delphi destroyed? Could I be a peasant
all my days?”</p>

<p>“You could never be a peasant,” said old Baltè
proudly, “and you would always have one slave. Old
Baltè will last long.”</p>

<p>“Dear Baltè,” she answered, and kissed her. Baltè
was a Helot from Sparta and some high Spartan blood
ran in her veins.</p>

<p>But Baltè had more to tell.</p>

<p>“Yesterday came a runner. Poor lad, he was sore
spent. Your father brought him in from the highroad
and gave him wine and made the slaves rub him well.
Then he sent him on his way to Sparta wi’ another
runner to help in case he fall.”</p>

<p>“Whence came the runner?” asked Theria.</p>

<p>“From Leonidas at Thermopylæ. He was to beg the
Spartans to come quick and help.”</p>

<p>“Those laggard Spartans,” cried Theria. “Why
do they not go to help their king without his begging
and summoning?”</p>

<p>“Leonidas is already fighting the Persians—he and
his Spartans,” said Baltè proudly. “So few against so
many. Only three hundred Spartans and a few allies.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
If the Persians beat they’ll be comin’ straight here—straight
to Delphi.”</p>

<p>“But is there no one to help Leonidas—no one at
all?”</p>

<p>“The Athenians be helpin’, so they say. The
Athenians’ ships, Missy. But the Persian ships be
twenty to one. Oh, dearie, if only a sea storm would
fall upon the Persians. Medon keeps wishin’ for a
storm. Medon was a sailor long ago and he knows the
ways of ships. He says the Athenian ships would be
safe in the Eubœan Strait where they are now. But
the Persians be outside around some rocky points up
there. A storm would wreck them sure.”</p>

<p>Theria suddenly awakened to the fact that her heart
was overflowing with interest. Just as she used to do
when she was pent up at home and could do nothing,
would beat her hands together, agonized because she
could do nothing. Now that some power was in those
hands, would she abandon it? She trowed not! Oh, if
she only knew the question before the Oracle!</p>

<p>But she could in no wise find this out. Then she
must give her oracle as best she might not knowing the
question—trusting that it must in some way concern
the fate of Greece.</p>

<p>She would pray for that storm which was to help
the Athenian ships. Baltè’s word showed her the
way.</p>

<p>Theria might doubt the voice of her Golden God, she
might almost doubt the existence of Apollo. But the
things of Nature—the sea, the mountains, the winds—these
she could see or feel. These to her were persons,
clear-imaged, well known, and having much power.
They were gods nearer to men in whom all men must
believe. To these Theria still could pray.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span></p>

<p>When the day came she once more mounted the fateful
tripod.</p>

<p>This, then, was the oracle which Eleutheria the
Pythoness gave to Hellas:</p>

<p>That oracle is famous. Never in all the history of
Delphi was an oracle received in such dire need. Never
one which to the Delphians themselves was more precious.
For it was the Delphians themselves who had
asked the question and to whose hearts the oracle gave
courage and hope.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>They sent messengers at once, carrying the precious
words of courage northward to the ships of Artemisium
and to the little band of heroes at Thermopylæ, and
eastward to Athens city, crying:</p>

<p>“Apollo, the Son of Leto, is on our side. He bids us
pray to the Winds.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MESSENGERS</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Aristonikè</span> was dying. No more did she notice
even the linnet, Theria’s gift, which sang so
sweetly in the solemn house.</p>

<p>A fever burned through all her limbs. As evening
came on old Tuchè was fain to take her out of the close
house and lay her in front of the door on the high temple
platform.</p>

<p>And because the little maid would not go without
Theria, Theria came also. So they two sat, Theria
and Tuchè, on either side the couch.</p>

<p>Little do the young consider thoughts of the old.
Theria did not guess that Tuchè hated her because
Aristonikè loved. The little Pythia was Tuchè’s
nurseling and Tuchè was cut to the heart to have her
turn to another in her last hours.</p>

<p>But Theria, holding the hot little hand, had thoughts
afar off. Her soul was in bitterness because she had
again deceived her god. That was yesterday and she
was yet weak from the ordeal. She wondered if Eëtíon
would cease to love her if he knew what she had done.
Certainly her father would not love her, nor would
any of her kin.</p>

<p>Far below lay the sheer abyss of Pleistos valley.
Nearer at hand Delphi itself nestled into the gigantic half
circle at the mountains’ base. Precinct and town seemed
floating in a violet mist. For the day was nearly done.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>But this was the hour of the Phaidriades, the glory
of the cliffs. Theria turned and looked above to where
they stood facing the west. The setting sun poured
his light direct upon these high embattling walls
turning them to gold, to beryl, to amethyst. They
gave forth light again as with a shout, a clashing of
golden cymbals, and a prayer. They hushed the
spirit of the gazing priestess.</p>

<p>As the reflected light retired upward with the sinking
of the sun one spot on the cliff held the glitter. It was
the famous votive chariot of Gelon, a chariot of polished
bronze.</p>

<p>It stood on a high ledge of the cliff, its four bronze
steeds prancing with that lightness of poise just learned
by Greek craftsmen. In the car stood the naked chariot
victor and just behind him the charioteer holding
the reins, his living eyes watchful of his steeds.</p>

<p>But to Theria it seemed that he was driving them
over the ledge, was driving them into the sheer abyss
and that he did not care.</p>

<p>Would the gods so drive her Delphi to destruction?
Would Atè (doomed Fate) tread Delphi down? Whose
feet are delicate because she steps upon the heads of
men, and on whom she steps she bows to the dust.</p>

<p>Ah, the Persians were so near! At Thermopylæ.
Were they victorious? If so, they would march directly
upon Delphi. They were not one week’s time
away. The doom of Delphi pressed so close, so sure.</p>

<p>Even the temple guardsman seemed to feel it as he
paced his beat. Now he walked slowly, dignified in his
armour, now he hastened with nervous steps to and fro.</p>

<p>Aristonikè awoke, complaining. “The thirst, the
thirst. Tuchè, bring water. Not warm water; cold,
fresh from the spring.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span></p>

<p>Tuchè rose up, flattered that her dear one had asked
this of her, and went upon the errand.</p>

<p>No sooner had she disappeared than the guard halted
short in his beat, looked about him—then almost ran
toward the Pythia House.</p>

<p>He touched Theria’s shoulder and she rose with a
cry. It seemed as though her thoughts had suddenly
become visible, for there beneath the helmet was the
face of Eëtíon. Pale white he was. Then flushed with
unbidden joy as he touched her.</p>

<p>“Eleutheria,” he whispered. “I had to come. Your
oracle to the Winds. The Delphians have sent it to
Artemisium and the fleet and also to Athens. It is
precious beyond words, for it will hearten men to victory.
Nay, the winds themselves will answer it; for
what god could resist so insistent a prayer.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she whispered—wondering that he should
come to tell her this.</p>

<p>“But your brothers! Oh, beloved, it is no happy
tidings I bring you. Your brothers are in league with
the Persians. They are with the Persian spies. They
have gone after our Delphian messengers to kill them
on the road.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Eëtíon, no, no!” she interrupted him in low
voice. “Not my Lycophron! Not my Dryas!”</p>

<p>“Yes, it is true. I saw them start: Lycophron
toward Thermopylæ and Dryas toward Athens. If it
become known in Delphi it will mean the ruin of Nikander’s
house. But your father will have to know in
order to stop them. He would not believe me. But
you he will believe because you are Pythia. Send for
him at once, Theria, tell him to dispatch swift horsemen
to save the oracle for Greece. I go now on instant
business.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span></p>

<p>He paused for a moment, gazing into her face. “Hera
be thanked that I have seen thee. O thou peer of
gods, thou sister of the dawn.”</p>

<p>He bent and kissed the edge of her sleeve. He dared
no more. She was priestess of Apollo.</p>

<p>Then he was gone. Before she could answer or think
of answer he was gone. He knew that to linger might
likely be her death.</p>

<p>Theria’s thoughts whirled like a falling star.</p>

<p>She must send for her father. Yet her father could
not have speech with her. Eëtíon did not know this,
not being Delphian.</p>

<p>And even if Nikander could have speech, would
Tuchè send for him? Tuchè refused regularly her
every request. And Theria could not give reason for
this request without betraying her brothers.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Lycophron and Dryas were hastening to
their doom and to the doom of Hellas. For Theria
ardently believed now that the prayer to the winds
would avail.</p>

<p>What could she do? Like a sword’s stroke came the
thought: “Run home yourself, Theria. Now while
Tuchè yet lingers in the house. There is no time to
lose.”</p>

<p>Aristonikè was sleeping again. Theria snatched a
dark himation which lay for cover on the couch and
wrapping herself, head and all, ran to the protection
of the temple-colonnade, along this she hurried, the
columns would conceal her, soon an angle of the cella
would intervene.</p>

<p>Then she reached the Sacred Way and walked not too
fast so as to avoid question.</p>

<p>Her weakness from yesterday’s ordeal was instantly
gone. She only prayed that Nikander might be at<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
home, that his action might be swift. And now for the
highroad; now for the familiar street; now for the
dearest house which she had thought never to see again!</p>

<p>Medon tottered to his feet at sight of her. More
natural would it have been to see the ghost of his little
mistress than herself.</p>

<p>“Is Father within?” she asked, but did not stay for
answer. She sped into the aula and, oh, thanks be to
Kairos, Nikander was there.</p>

<p>He, too, looked upon her as upon a dire spirit. Only
madness could have brought her. But more terrible
than his wildest conjecture were her words.</p>

<p>“Father, Father, it is bitter news I bring. Lycophron,
Dryas. They have Medized and are fled with
Persian spies. They are gone to hold back the Oracle
message from all the Hellenes.”</p>

<p>Nikander sprang up, seizing her wrist, searching her
face.</p>

<p>“Child, what madness! They are not gone away.”</p>

<p>“Oh, are they in the house—now?” She almost
sobbed with relief.</p>

<p>“I saw them both only an hour ago.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but within the hour they are gone far. Dryas
to Athens, Lycophron to Thermopylæ. Father, search
the house. Send after them quick, quick.” She
seized both his shoulders, shaking them as if to waken
him to the sorrow.</p>

<p>“Where did you get this information?” Nikander
was pitiful of her strange mistake.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you. It came, it came.” Her eyes
looked so strange and glittering, her whole aspect so
bordering on delirium or even ecstasy, that Nikander
touched her gently.</p>

<p>“Was it by some prophetic power?—vision?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span></p>

<p>Theria was so upwrought that she spoke out her first
instinctive thought.</p>

<p>“No—no prophecy. Do not speak of prophecy. I
am not deceiving. This is real, real.”</p>

<p>The words escaped the door of her lips. She was
aghast at the net of lies closing about her. Of course
if she should tell her father it was prophecy he would
believe. But she would not lie to him, not even——</p>

<p>She did not know that as she thought these things
guilt stood manifest in her face.</p>

<p>Nikander caught her arm, roughly, asking the thing
he did not want to know—the thing he had been
suspecting for many days.</p>

<p>“Theria, your Athenian oracle—Great Zeus in
Olympos, have you deceived in all your oracles?”</p>

<p>She sank in a heap on the floor.</p>

<p>“Father, Father; the need! It was such bitter need—and
no ecstasy would come. The Athenians—the—the——” Her
weeping choked her speech.</p>

<p>Nikander was too horrified to answer. With hand
before his eyes he kept repeating: “Great heaven!
great heaven!” Suddenly he lifted his head again. “If
the oracle is not from the god, why, in Zeus’s name, this
pother about it—the words of a girl?”</p>

<p>“Father—but it is important. The Athenians will
offer true sacrifice to the winds. They will be hopeful
in their prayers, in their fighting. The oracle gladdens
the fighters.”</p>

<p>But Nikander’s mind had never left his sons.</p>

<p>“Theria, who told you this vile tale about your
brothers?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I cannot tell you. I——”</p>

<p>“If it were from some good source, you would tell
me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span></p>

<p>Theria dragged herself up to her knees. “It was a
good source. Oh, Father, the truest, the best, the
kindest.” Poor Theria; even to speak of her lover set
her white face aflame.</p>

<p>But Nikander was pushing further. “Theria, I
begin to believe what the slaves have been telling in the
household, that you have a lover. Now do not lie to
me. Your lover brought you this news.”</p>

<p>Theria was utterly broken down. She could only
moan, “But he told me the truth. He told me in order
to save them. He told me because he loves my house
and you and he wants to save us from ruin.”</p>

<p>“Great Paian, what a heap of sins on one girl’s head!
She has deceived on the tripod, not once, but twice.
She has a lover—she a priestess of Apollo. Now she has
fled the Pythia House (which she ought never to have
left) to bring a monstrous lie against her brothers.”
To Nikander the shock of all this was terrible beyond
belief. But worst of all, he feared that the vile tale
about his sons was true. Oh, if he could crush that fear
out of his mind. It must not be true. It could not——</p>

<p>He paced up and down the room beating his hands
together weeping, sobbing, as only those can who, but
once in a lifetime, give way to grief.</p>

<p>“My children all against me. But no, it cannot be
true. Ruin for them, ruin for me. It cannot be. No!”</p>

<p>Theria crept weakly to her feet and followed him, but
as she touched him he reeled from her.</p>

<p>“Don’t touch me!” he cried.</p>

<p>Suddenly his agony was transformed to anger.</p>

<p>“You—you—tell that tale, oh, how easily! It is not
true. Leave me. I am beside myself. Your sins are
more than I can bear. And now you add yet more.
You will ruin my sons.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span></p>

<p>“Father, Father,” she pleaded.</p>

<p>“My poor wicked Theria. What place is there for
you anywhere? Not at home here, not in the Pythia
House. Oh, I know not what to do for you. No, I will
never believe that story. Leave me before I go mad!”</p>

<p>He was so beside himself that he did not notice when
she shrank away from him and staggered out of the
door. Indeed he continued to speak in the same words,
“Leave me—I will not believe you. Leave me!”</p>

<p>Suddenly she touched his arm again, or so he thought.
He uncovered his face to find Medon standing before
him—Medon with eyes astream with tears.</p>

<p>“Master, Master, I knew that if the little mistress
appeared it was some terrible thing. Master, I know
what she has told you. You called so bitter loud upon
your sons. I know, I know!”</p>

<p>“Leave me, Medon,” said Nikander angrily. He was
still pacing up and down. But Medon did not leave.</p>

<p>“Master, I had not the courage to tell you. But I
can follow the little mistress’s telling. Lycophron,
Dryas, oh, you must haste to save them.”</p>

<p>Nikander stopped his pacing, and gazed into Medon’s
face as though he comprehended not a word of what
the old man was saying.</p>

<p>Medon piteously went on, “Lycophron and Dryas
thought I could not hear, but I heard them talking; oh,
I heard too well. And the men who have been with
them, they are spies, Master. The slaves have long
been whispering that those men were Persian spies.
To-day I was very anxious. All day I have watched.
And this afternoon I followed Lycophron to where he
had swift horses waiting and those men were there. I
do not know where they were going, but it was on some
wicked errand. For when Master Lycophron saw me,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
he caught me. He threatened to kill me if I told.
The men wanted to kill me at once. Oh, Master,
haste! haste, there is no time to lose.”</p>

<p>“Yes—yes,” said Nikander, dazed into bitter quietness.
“Yes, Medon, thank you.”</p>

<p>He stood quite still while his thoughts raced. Then
he ran out of the house to summon youths of the nearest
kin who owned the swiftest horses.</p>

<span class="smaller">AN OUTCAST ON PARNASSOS</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Theria</span> stood still in front of the house. She
was stunned as one must be when life turns a
sharp corner and shows undreamed-of paths of
dread. “No place in the Pythia House, no place at
home—anywhere.” Her father’s words were true.
She did not feel sad nor terrified. She did not feel at all.</p>

<p>She looked down the twilit road toward Kirrha, the
port. No, in Kirrha they would find her and kill her
publicly. She must not die that way. The Pleistos
glen also was out of the question. The hills! Her
true hiding place was the hills. She turned swiftly into
the little lane and threaded its shadows to the cliff.
A steep climb brought her to a height above the house-roofs.
Here at once she was in the wilds, on a slant
hillside where grew laurel, wild olive, and the hemlock.
Here the twilight was silvered by the rising moon, the
same full round under which the Thermopylæ soldiers
were keeping their heroic guard.</p>

<p>Here the laurels were threaded by a slender path,
surely the one made by Eëtíon’s feet coming to her.
She knelt down and kissed it. The Greeks were lovers
of the earth and not seldom did they kiss it for their
love. Oh, gods, if she could but hide herself completely!
Then Eëtíon would never know her sins and would
continue to love her.</p>

<p>She tried to make haste, but her whole body ached<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
with weariness as though she were very old. The repeated
fastings had told even on her strong body.</p>

<p>She won past the higher terraces of hill and found
the so-called Kaka Skala, “bad stairs” indeed, steps
partly hewn out of the rock and winding up Parnassos
Mountain until they were lost in cloud. These she
began to climb. No thought was hers to see the glory
about her, the crags ghost-like in the moon, the abyss
of glens black with fir and cedar, the heights which
soared and melted into infinity, the starry sky—a
grandeur hardly to be borne. Theria only knew that
she was very lonely, that the grandeur was terrible.
She seemed very small and childlike in that vastness,
stumbling along ever slower, stopping sometimes with
labouring breath, then pushing on again higher, higher.</p>

<p>In an upland meadow she passed a herd of cows,
small wild things which fled trampling at her approach.
She thought vaguely of the cattle of Apollo, which he
kept on Parnassos and which of yore the baby Hermes
had stolen. Of course, these could be no other cows.
She shuddered at the supernatural creatures. Now
she came to a fir wood, black like a cloak. The mottled
moonlight sifted in at the edge pricking out fern-brake
and rock, but within it was ebony. In such a place
might the Bacchantes well go mad in worship of their
god. With a sob she entered it. For the fear of being
found was greater than her fear of the haunted place.</p>

<p>Theria lay down to rest among the mosses. Even
her double terror could not contend against her utter
exhaustion. At once she fell asleep.</p>

<p>She awoke in the dawn shivering with cold, hungry
beyond telling. The fear with which she had gone to
sleep, the fear of being found, met her at the door of
waking. It made her get up and, though she ached in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
every bone, to push onward, upward into safer hiding.
Sometimes she came to a bare stretch across which she
stumbled in haste. For surely in such a place they
would see her, and would catch her and drag her back
and doubtless bury her alive. In this thought she forgot
even her old grief for the loss of her god. Indeed
she half believed that this present fate of hers was
Apollo’s punishment which he had delayed so long.</p>

<p>Now again she must cross a bare upland. The sun
was high and burning as it can burn only on such heights.
She started across in the fearsome blinding glare, the
sweat pouring from every member. Curiously enough,
in the midst of the sunlight she saw moving along in
front of her—<em>a shaft of golden light</em>! When she entered a
shadow of jutting cliff the golden light endured in the
shadow. If she paused, it paused. It was quiet as if a
dream pervaded it. It seemed to smile as do those
faces that peep from bushes or caves, which smile and
afterward destroy.</p>

<p>Theria shrank back. It shrank with her. No evading
it that way. A terror seized her. She wrung her
hands. Should she run back to the forest? No, there
it would only gain power. She tried to remember a
charm against spirits which Baltè had taught her, but
she had no memory left. Now a lofty cliff baulked her
path. Against this cliff, facing her, the light stopped
and stayed very tall and stately. It quivered, growing
brighter to a focus, and suddenly out from it as from a
sheath stepped a youth, tall as befits an Immortal and
of beauty tender as the dawn. Golden were his tresses,
golden his flowing vesture, golden his sandalled feet
which did not touch the ground. But the quiver girt
upon his shoulder was silver-white, silver also the bent
bow in his hand.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span></p>

<p>Should she not know him, she who had known him so
well? Up went her hands in worship; up higher yet
her worshipping heart.</p>

<p>“Thou hast come to kill me,” she whispered.
“Blessed art thou, glorious child of Leto. Not lightly
shall thy dear Oracle be flouted and thy worshippers
deceived.”</p>

<p>Apollo did not gaze upon Theria, else she would forthwith
have died. But just above her he gazed, delicately
smiling, and as he smiled, he toyed with his
silver bow. Already was the shaft set on the string,
and along that arrow back and forth ran the white fire
which whensoever it reached the tip broke into flame.
Now he nodded his head and spoke aloud:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Theria, daughter of Delphi, begone from my tripod!</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No priestess of mine art thou.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">No voice of Apollo can enter thy mind close-guarded with reason,</div>
    <div class="verse indent20">Begone! Begone!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Theria cowered before that voice, crouching to the
earth.</p>

<p>But the god spoke on, almost tenderly, as to a
frightened child:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Nay, cower not, my maiden, my bow shall not hurt thee.</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nay, for I love thee. Hast thou not sung at my bidding</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Hymns for my glory, songs which I to thy spirit</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">Breathed and created?”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Suddenly the god threw back his golden head and
laughed. And with his laughter the cliffs echoed as
with stricken lyres and heavenly flutings. He was
laughing at Theria!</p>

<p>He spoke again:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span></p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Thou poor child of a mortal wouldst compel good fortune for Hellas</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><em>Steal</em> it—from gods unwilling! Good lack! But I love thy courage!</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But now behold, little one, wilt thou grant me to speak in Delphi?</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ha, thou advisor of gods. Thou helper of gods in trouble,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Without thee Apollo shall succour. Without thee give aid to his people</div>
  </div>
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent4"><span class="allsmcap">I SHALL CARE FOR MY OWN!</span>”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Again he laughed—a merry, loving mockery.</p>

<p>Oh, the dear joyous god! the dear Son of Leto—Phœbus
of the bright hair! Had he not always
spoken at Delphi since his glorious mother bore him
upon Delos? And Theria had doubted! Her heart
filled with a very agony of faith and joy.</p>

<p>But now the god was looking again at his bow. Perhaps
he had changed his mind, and would destroy her,
after all. Even so, Theria had no regret to die.</p>

<p>But he spoke thus—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“See now, child of Nikander, whither my arrows are destined.”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>He turned, lifted his bow, and shot the flaming shaft
toward the north. It flew with a peal like a lightning
bolt when the bolt falls so nigh that it quenches the
thunder; it soared white and blinding over the peak of
Parnassos and fell crashing beyond.</p>

<p>But with the noise of the arrow Theria fell prone
on the earth and knew nothing more.</p>

<span class="smaller">EËTÍON PURSUES</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Eëtíon</span> had said to Theria that he was going
upon an urgent quest. The quest was indeed
an urgent one. Eëtíon set about it instinctively,
not considering how little chance there was of its success.
It was nothing less than to save Dryas.</p>

<p>Eëtíon had come to know Nikander’s sons well. He
had met them in palæstra and lesche. Being foreign
born himself, he had also often been thrown with the
other young foreigners who were Lycophron’s friends.
These men called themselves Athenians, but Eëtíon believed
that they were really Ionians and that they were
in Delphi for no good purpose. As for the men themselves,
they were inclined to consort with Eëtíon as an
Argive because of the secret league of Argos with Persia.
And while they did not talk with him of their projects,
they were less careful in his presence than they might
otherwise have been.</p>

<p>Eëtíon, meanwhile, being ardent for the Hellenic
cause, had kept quiet watch of the disguised Ionians and
later of Nikander’s sons as well. He had hitherto
found nothing worthy of note. But to-day a chance
word of Dryas’s had given him a clue. Then by careful
watching he had learned that couriers bearing the
oracle were to be intercepted.</p>

<p>Dryas had a boyish devotion to Eëtíon, first because
of Eëtíon’s beauty and also because of his prowess in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
wrestling and fast running, combined gifts which easily
made a hero in Greece.</p>

<p>And Eëtíon, touched by the boy’s love for him, had
wished many a day to save Dryas from his treacherous
companions. This he had not dared to attempt because
the weak boy would have babbled and all Eëtíon’s
chance to watch the Ionians be lost.</p>

<p>But now Eëtíon thought he had a chance to save
Dryas. Lycophron had gone to cut off the Thermopylæ
messengers because he was heart and hand
with Persia. Dryas had gone with those who were
intercepting the message to Athens because of weakness
and fear. Eëtíon, therefore, the instant he had given
word to Theria, hastened to get a horse to pursue
Dryas. Horses were few in Delphi where they were of
so little use. He returned to the Great Temple where
workmen painting the crimson columns had left their
paint. Here he smeared a red gash upon his knee and
stained the breast of his cloak. Like Odysseus,
Eëtíon was a man of many devices. Then mounting,
he hurried from Delphi along the Athens road. He
trusted much to the swiftness of his horse. The spies
must go at the pace of their worst steed, nor would they
feel any special need of haste. So Eëtíon hoped to
overtake them. The highway was very clear under the
bright moon. It was a mountain road and mountain
rough. But the Argives were lovers of horses and
Eëtíon had not forgotten his early skill. Sometimes he
held tight rein and rode with careful slowness; again,
whenever the stretch was good, he dug heels into the
flanks of his horse and galloped hard.</p>

<p>What man when at a gallop has not dreamed of his
beloved? And Eëtíon had just seen Theria’s face
again beyond all hope. So thin and changed it was, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
its frailness almost like a child’s, and very pitiful. And
oh, that little cry of joy when she saw him. That
sounded again and again in his mind and mingled with
the fragrance of the mountain road.</p>

<p>So he passed the town of Daulis. Some distance
beyond Daulis he saw the men he was pursuing.</p>

<p>As soon as he neared them he began to cry out to
them, cries of suffering and distress. He saw them
stop. He dashed into their midst.</p>

<p>“For the sake of the gods, save me, save me!” he cried.</p>

<p>“What is it? What is it?” Ionians were always
quick of sympathy.</p>

<p>“Robbers set upon me. I was going to Orchomenos
on a mission. You fellows can guess what kind it was.
But, oh, stop the blood. See, it trails in the road.”</p>

<p>At this Dryas dashed up.</p>

<p>“Eëtíon,” he exclaimed, going pale. “Great Zeus!
Dear fellow.”</p>

<p>Eëtíon displayed his horrible red knee and leg and as
he did so reeled in Dryas’s arms. “Help me,” he
pleaded. “Don’t leave me.” Then Eëtíon lay in the
road with closed eyes and heard them talking.</p>

<p>“We ought not to stop at all. You know that.”</p>

<p>“We’ve got to stop,” said Dryas’s voice, half weeping.
“I for one will not let him lie here to die.”</p>

<p>“But we can’t leave you here, Dryas. We need you
in Athens. Who will introduce us to Themistokles?”</p>

<p>“I won’t leave him, you’ve got to wait.”</p>

<p>Some of them drew aside, discussing the matter in low
tones. Eëtíon strained his ear to hear. He heard a
scornful laugh.</p>

<p>“Suppose we do leave Dryas here, will he join us in
Athens? By the gods, he will! Wasn’t he beside himself
to come?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span></p>

<p>This was true. Poor Dryas was hoping to get ship
from Athens and save himself in the Islands. He was
terrified at the certain impending destruction of Delphi.
He had ever pleaded to accompany the party.</p>

<p>“Very well, Dryas,” they said at last. “You stay.
We’ll send you help. You can leave Eëtíon at Daulis.
Then follow quickly. Do you hear?”</p>

<p>So they cantered away.</p>

<p>Dryas started off for water, but Eëtíon called him
back again, allowing himself to revive.</p>

<p>“Get me on my horse,” he faltered. “I must get to
Daulis if I can.”</p>

<p>“Dear Eëtíon, dear, dear fellow,” said the affectionate
Dryas.</p>

<p>They remounted, and soon the distance was doubling
between Theria’s brother and the killers of his soul.</p>

<p>At the edge of Daulis Eëtíon drove his horse close so
as to touch Dryas’s arm.</p>

<p>“Dryas,” he said in a low voice, “do you want to do
that vile deed?”</p>

<p>Dryas started violently, and Eëtíon caught his
wrist. Eëtíon could throw Dryas at a wrestle like a
child.</p>

<p>“What deed?” Dryas asked between chattering
teeth.</p>

<p>“You know very well what deed. Will you let your
father and your mother die without lifting your hand to
help, while you save yourself—a renegade, a Persian
serf?”</p>

<p>“Let me go, let me go!” cried Dryas wildly.</p>

<p>“Yes, I shall let you go, I will not bring you back
against your will. That would be folly. But think.
Perhaps your father already knows this. If so, he
longs to die. Think of the shame, Dryas.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span></p>

<p>Dryas began to breathe as if weeping.</p>

<p>“Think of the glory of fighting for Delphi,” went on
Eëtíon’s low voice. “The rich glory. And if you will
fight I will make you my brother-at-arms. Yes, even
knowing what I know. You are a skilful fighter, Dryas.
You will not fail in the fight.”</p>

<p>Suddenly the sobbing breaths stopped and Dryas
sat up straight and urged his horse forward. “Quick,
quick,” he said, “before they come back after me.”
Then he reined in the gallop. “Eëtíon, forgive me.
Your wound!” he said.</p>

<p>“My wound is red paint,” said Eëtíon, laughing.
“Thus I was wounded for your sake.”</p>

<p>“And, and you came out for my sake——” At this
Dryas began to weep indeed.</p>

<p>They passed Daulis, and hurried on under the setting
moon. Dryas was silent now, only urging his horse
so fast that Eëtíon had to check him for fear of accident.
In the dark they met a party of men hurrying
toward Athens as if mad. Eëtíon knew what they
were and Dryas guessed, and he hid his face in his cloak
as they rushed by. They were Nikander’s kinsmen
riding to intercept those who would withhold the good
oracle from Athens.</p>

<p>Toward dawn the two riders neared Delphi, and at
the familiar road-sights Dryas lifted his face, saying to
himself:</p>

<p>“Safe, safe!”</p>

<p>“Safe?” asked Eëtíon, “where the Persians will certainly
come to harry and destroy?”</p>

<p>“Yes, safe,” answered Dryas, “safe from worse than
the Persians!” and with Greek affection he reached for
Eëtíon’s hand and kissed it.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XXX">CHAPTER XXX<br />
<span class="smaller">SHEPHERD WISDOM</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Nikander</span> had returned to his aula and sat
there with face of stone. The kinsmen had
gone. He himself had sent the doom upon his
sons. For him Delphi was already in the dust. The
Persians had no need to destroy her.</p>

<p>Suddenly a running step outside, and the door burst
open. There in a flood of morning light came Dryas
like Hermes running with outstretched arms. He fell
at his father’s feet, embracing his waist, hiding his face
in his lap.</p>

<p>“Father! Father! Father!” he cried.</p>

<p>Nikander fell forward at the shock of joy, trembling
and unable to speak. Then he righted himself, heard
as in a dream the boy in his arms talking to him.</p>

<p>“Only some god saved me! I want to fight for you,
Father—to fight at your side.”</p>

<p>“You did not go with the spies? Not after all?”
Nikander said dazedly.</p>

<p>“Yes, Father, but——”</p>

<p>Here Eëtíon, whom both had forgotten, stepped forward
and touched Dryas’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“They abducted him, Nikander,” he said clearly. “It
was only by a ruse that I saved him. Oh, if you could
have seen the joy in the boy’s face when I got him free.”</p>

<p>“I see the joy in his face now,” said Nikander.
Nikander believed because he so wanted to believe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span></p>

<p>“Tell your father how I fooled them,” urged Eëtíon,
and Dryas between trembling and laughter told the
story of Eëtíon’s red paint wound. But before he had
finished, Nikander rose, took Eëtíon’s hand, and drew
him to an embrace.</p>

<p>“Oh, you good youth!” he said, “I can never thank
you, never fully thank you. No kinsman shall be so
dear as you.”</p>

<p>Now the only shadow on Nikander’s joy was his
anxiety for Lycophron. Dear gods, where might his
son be now? Even if Delphi survived the onslaught of
the Persians this sorrow would remain. Nikander
could never speak his son Lycophron’s name.</p>

<p>A slave brought their breakfast, and as they ate the
figs and bread and milk they began to talk seriously of
Delphi’s plans of escape. Many citizens had already
carried their household treasures up the mountain to
the Korykian cave. And the priests were now urging
a further questioning of the god if perchance even yet
he might reveal to them some way to save the Holy
Place. Dryas entered into the plans with an interest
and fearlessness which caused his father to look at
him ever and again. What had happened to Dryas?
What brave-minded god was thus changing his son?</p>

<p>Such was their conversation when a temple slave
came running in at the door past Medon, saying
breathlessly:</p>

<p>“The Pythoness, your daughter, is nowhere in the
Pythia House. Is she here, Nikander?”</p>

<p>Nikander hid his eyes confusedly a moment.</p>

<p>“Yes,” he said, “yes, she is here; I had forgotten. I
will bring her back myself and explain. Tell that to
Tuchè. Dryas, dear lad, go you and fetch your sister.”</p>

<p>The slave added with embarrassment: “And, Master,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
I was to tell you that Tuchè is very angry. They wish
to begin the rites at once. Consultants are waiting
and the priests are there. Aristonikè is too ill to go
upon the tripod and they have no Pythia.”</p>

<p>“Oh, unkind gods,” breathed Nikander. His heart
had ached every time his daughter was set upon the
terrible high seat of the god. Now how much more
would it ache knowing how she had deceived. She
must not go there again. Must never again give an
oracle. She was no fit subject for the ecstasy. He
must find some chance to tell her this. Must command
her to resist the trance no matter what rites were
practised. But oh, what a terrible fate for the poor
child. Back to the Pythia House. Of course she
must go back.</p>

<p>He started to meet her before she could come downstairs.</p>

<p>But here Dryas returned with amazed face, and
Melantho with him, running down into the forbidden
aula because of her anxiety.</p>

<p>“How could you think Theria was in the house?”
asked Dryas.</p>

<p>“She has not been here. She is nowhere here,” urged
Melantho.</p>

<p>Again Nikander paused, confused. What had he
said to the child? What harsh words? He had not
meant them. Of course he had not meant them. But
surely she had not gone forth from the house.</p>

<p>Melantho was bringing in old Medon who knew all
who came and went.</p>

<p>“What is it? What?” asked the poor deaf man.
“Yes, little mistress was here, but she went away—back
to the Pythia House. Yesterday evening early.
Very sad she looked, and staggered as she went.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span></p>

<p>So at last they knew that Theria was abroad.</p>

<p>Nikander’s face hardened with bitter anxiety.</p>

<p>“Come, Dryas,” he said. “We must find her at
once.”</p>

<p>Dryas turned to Eëtíon, “Dearest Eëtíon, you will
help us?”</p>

<p>As for Eëtíon, through what a range of feeling had he
been carried in these moments? First, joy like an
unbidden melody, because his beloved was in the house;
then strong joy because he might see her as she passed;
then horror at her disappearance. Why had she gone?
What had Nikander done to her to make her run away?
What cruel thing had he said? But there was no time
even to be angry. Theria must be found and that
quickly before the Persians should arrive. Eëtíon
looked at Nikander, begging for a boon.</p>

<p>“If I might help to find her,” he ventured; “but let
me go my own way while you go another. We must
search everywhere at once.”</p>

<p>Nikander read his unspoken fear. Women must not
be abroad when the Persians were in the country.
There was not an instant to lose.</p>

<p>“Nikander, I am presumptuous to give advice,” said
Eëtíon. “But send also messengers to the port. I
beg you do that.”</p>

<p>It seemed to Nikander that he was sending messengers
to the four quarters of the earth for his vanished
children. He answered hurriedly:</p>

<p>“Dear Eëtíon, you are wise, I can hardly think out
this thing.” He was too occupied to notice Eëtíon’s
emotion.</p>

<p>Dryas had meantime fetched a fresh chiton for his
friend. “You cannot go forth in that stained cloak,”
he told him. “Dear Eëtíon, how excited you are, how<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
like a kinsman you care for us. We’ll find her in a half
hour. She ran away once before, you know. I know
exactly where she’s run to.”</p>

<p>Eëtíon was so angry that he dared not answer
Dryas. How little the shallow fellow knew of his
sister’s character and ways. Eëtíon was glad when
they all left the house.</p>

<p>How foolish they were, running hither and yon
without thought. In Eëtíon’s Argos were many
shepherds and when a sheep was lost they did not go
forth in this wise, but first thought about the paths,
and the simple sheep reasoning, and then went and
found.</p>

<p>This flight of Theria’s was of course connected with
the message which Eëtíon had himself given to her.
She had not sent for her father, but, true heart that
she was, she had brought the news herself. But why
had she fled forth like this?</p>

<p>He took Medon into the street.</p>

<p>“Tell me, Medon, was Nikander angry with his
daughter?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Master, how should I know?” But Eëtíon
saw at once that Medon did know and did not rest until
he got the truth of him.</p>

<p>Then he went back into the house and called Baltè.</p>

<p>“Baltè,” he said, “take with you two men slaves and
go up on Parnassos by the far eastern path and look
for your mistress.”</p>

<p>“But, Master, surely she would not go there. Wolves
are there.”</p>

<p>“She would not stop for wolves,” Said Eëtíon sharply,
and Baltè saw his eyes fill with tears.</p>

<p>“If you reach to the Korykian cave, Baltè, and yet
do not find her, then come down by the hither path and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
I will meet you at the top of the Bad Steps. Give me a
flask of wine and my sword there.”</p>

<p>Then Eëtíon fairly ran out and through the lane up
the slender path he knew so well.</p>

<p>On the hard rocky earth he could find no trace of
her. But still he climbed on, his heart aching for the
dear lonely child who had fled from unkindness and injustice.</p>

<p>Oh, how could Nikander have let forth upon her
gentle head the wrath that should have gone to his sons?
Where was his fatherly tenderness? How could he in
the first place have put her away in the Pythia House,
that cruelty, that fearfulness, tales of which were rife
in the Precinct? How could Nikander have placed her
there to be a barren maid, she who was so full of life,
so fit to be the mother of children? As Eëtíon mounted
his anger mounted with him. He longed intensely to
take her away from cruelty and neglect and to give
her henceforth only tenderness and the visionary love
that was his.</p>

<p>He climbed up the Kaka Skala, passed the wood in
which Theria had hidden over night, on up into the
pathless heights beyond her, into despair of finding
her alive. A mountain bear padded past him and
broke its way into the thicket to hide. “Oh, Artemis,
Protector of maidens; help the little maid who is now
in thy care alone!”</p>

<p>By some instinct, for Eëtíon could now no longer
reason, he turned back. He descended to the Kaka
Skala, he entered the wood, and there on a jagged
branch found some torn yellow shreds of dress.</p>

<p>Then as in fever he ran hither and yon searching;
found, now a broken twig, now a footprint. He began
to call, “Theria! Theria!” He lost time here for he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span>
was so sure she would stay hiding in the wood. But
at the last some god led him out upon the upland where
he caught a glimpse of a fluttering yellow garment on
the ground. He ran to it and at last saw her, slender
and prone, her hair lying in soft dark billows upon the
rock and hiding her face.</p>

<p>With a sob he knelt, lifted her in his arms and
tenderly put back her locks. Then he saw her death-whiteness
and the terrible gash upon her forehead
where she had hit the rock in her fall. He was too
wild at first to help her, kissing her, calling her, feeling
her cold hands, holding his lips against hers to make
sure if any breath was there.</p>

<p>But when she responded not at all Eëtíon grew more
careful. He brought out the wine but could not give
it between the set lips.</p>

<p>Then he gathered her in his arms to carry her up to
a spring which he remembered in the heights. He was
too frightened now to feel any emotion. He only knew
that he was carrying Theria away from Delphi, away
from the bitterness and mishandling. It was right
that he should do so. She belonged to him, to nobody
else in all the world! Away in some colony over seas
they could be truly wedded and live the years. He
even forgot her Apolline priesthood and the sacrilege
of loving such a one.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, perhaps she was dying in his arms.</p>

<p>In the upper slope among the firs he found his spring.
He laid the dear burden on the ground, bathed her
white face, bathed the wound and poured the wine into
it. At last life, like a visible prayer, came back into her
face and the colour of life was there.</p>

<p>Then indeed did Eros, the tall youth, earliest of all the
gods, send power into Eëtíon’s heart, filling it with a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
strange uplifting worship—that invisible power with
which the son of Chaos holds the cosmos together, Eros
the mighty one.</p>

<p>Now Theria opened her eyes. They were like black
lakes and lonely as the stars.</p>

<p>“Theria, darling, darling Theria. No harm shall
come to you now, Theria!”</p>

<p>But she looked straight into his face without a spark
of recognition.</p>

<p>“It is I—Eëtíon,” he said, taking her face between
his hands. “Kiss me, my maiden!”</p>

<p>“Apollon,” she murmured. “Apollon.” She did
not close her eyes again, but kept them fixed upon
Eëtíon’s face in a way that froze his spirit. Eëtíon
was not skilled in Apollo’s ways; he knew nothing of
mantic power by which men with their natural eyes
see things unseen. He could only recognize that
Theria’s spirit was farther from his than the farthest
planet.</p>

<p>“Apollon,” she said again.</p>

<p>She was in that far serenity that knows not time nor
change, the indifference that comes of too great knowledge
from the gods.</p>

<p>Of a certainty she was going to die, and that very
soon.</p>

<p>Eëtíon sprang to his feet. Fool, fool, that he was to
bring his darling where she could get no help from
leech or magic. If she died here it would be he who
had killed her. The fear of Apollo now came over
him. Apollo would blast them both if he took her
away for his own. Again he lifted Theria in his arms
and carried her back toward the path where he hoped
Baltè might meet him.</p>

<p>Baltè did not appear at the head of the Kaka Skala,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
but presently came Delphic citizens bearing their
household treasures to hide in the hills. These, seeing
the dying maiden, helped him gladly.</p>

<p>“Did the Persians hurt her? Are they already
come?” they asked, terrified.</p>

<p>“No,” said Eëtíon. “The maid was lost and fell
upon a rock.”</p>

<p>They gave their litter on which they had carried
their burdens and upon this Eëtíon and a slave of the
Delphians bore her down toward her old bitter fate
again, toward the priesthood and the torture. If she
should live at all, she would not live long in that
Pythia House. Eëtíon’s heart was dead within him
as he made the slow descent.</p>

<span class="smaller">NIKANDER’S NEAREST OF KIN</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Meanwhile</span>, Nikander and Dryas of the easy
confidence came to the temple of Athena
Forethought where this time no Theria was
to be found. Dryas looked into his father’s grieving
face.</p>

<p>“Theria ought to be ashamed of herself,” he said
stoutly, “to give you such trouble now.”</p>

<p>“Be silent, Dryas,” said his father sternly. “You
know nothing about your sister or her reason for this.
Try to find her. Try.”</p>

<p>“Father, I am sorry,” said the wondering Dryas,
taking his father’s hand.</p>

<p>“I want you to search now in the slave quarter,” said
Nikander hurriedly. “I will go to the Precinct whence
I will send messengers to Daulis.”</p>

<p>Wearily Nikander climbed the Precinct hill. His
memory was playing him curious tricks. His harsh
words, which at first he could in no wise recall, now
came back deadly clear, “No place in the Pythia House.
No place for you at the home hearth, Bringer of vile
tales.” Great Zeus! he had been god maddened, blind!
The girl had risked her life and reputation to save her
brothers from disgrace.</p>

<p>Theria was always doing the unexpected, poor child,
always bringing down wrath upon her own head, and
as he now saw it, doing something either interesting or<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_211"></a>[211]</span>
noble. What a Nikander she was, how true in every
instinct to her ancient race.</p>

<p>While these thoughts beset him Nikander was
hastening from treasury to treasury, hastening through
the hidden paths and secret places of the Precinct.
Each familiar statue, tripod, each quiet, chapel-like
treasury room pierced him with the thought of her
intense love of everything in Delphi. Her very deceptions
on the tripod had been only from her too great
love for Delphi and for Greece.</p>

<p>And her lover; poor little daughter, if he had but
kept closer to her in daily life (ah, she had tried so
wistfully to keep close to him), she would have told him
of this lover long ago.</p>

<p>Why had he not warned his child when he was making
her a priestess? He had put her on the perilous seat
of the tripod without one thought of her. He had
left her aidless and lonely. He was to blame, to
blame!</p>

<p>Near the Great Temple Dryas met him again, saying
that his search had been fruitless—asking where now
to go. Nikander caught his son’s hand convulsively.</p>

<p>“Go nowhere,” he pleaded. “Stay with me.”</p>

<p>But even as he clung to his boy he thought how impossible
it would be for Theria to do what Dryas had
done. No spies could have dragged her away on such
an errand. And oh, dear Paian, she would not have
companioned with them at all nor left her father
lonely through these terrible days. She would have
entered with him into every struggle for Delphi’s
honor if her father had only allowed her. How wistful
she was when she met him returning from Council.
What a sly little puss in her questioning, finding out
his problems which he did not mean to tell! Nikander<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
smiled, but in his smiling found himself blinded with
tears.</p>

<p>Dryas was sure that it was anxiety for Lycophron
which unmanned his father thus.</p>

<p>Long after nightfall the two came home again. The
slaves brought supper, and all unwilling they sat down
to eat. Then footsteps were heard in the doorway—Eëtíon
and the slave with Theria white on her litter.</p>

<p>Nikander ran to her, lifting her in his arms as though
she were a child, calling her endearing names, weeping
with relief. He laid her on a couch in the aula while
they brought the torches.</p>

<p>But one look at Theria’s face and wide-open eyes
sobered him.</p>

<p>“Theria, Theria,” he called to her terrible silence.</p>

<p>“Oh, Nikander, don’t you see that she is dying?”
cried Eëtíon, brokenhearted.</p>

<p>Nikander rose solemnly to his feet. “She has beheld a
god,” he said. “She is yet in the vision.” He turned
to Eëtíon. “Has she spoken any word?”</p>

<p>“She called upon Apollo thrice, but since then this
silence. Oh, Nikander, what does it mean?”</p>

<p>Nikander bowed his head. Knowing what he knew
of Theria’s sacrilege, he fully believed this state to be a
doom from Phœbus himself. He believed that she
would die. And when he lifted his head, trying to speak,
Eëtíon’s anger melted before the anguish in his face.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nikander as a worshipper of Apollo had recognized
at once the mantic ecstasy. He knew also the accepted
means of breaking the ecstatic state. He had
Baltè bathe Theria in warm water and gently rub her
body. He himself brought his lyre and sitting at the
bedside played strong, clear music in the Doric mode.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span></p>

<p>Then fearing that he might have omitted some act,
he went out and fetched in the priests to look at her.
They gazed, awestruck. “Yes, you are doing all you
can,” they said. “The maid is certainly in a vision.
But she is far gone toward Hades.”</p>

<p>So Nikander resumed his post. Sitting there, patiently
playing, he was the more convinced that she
would die. Even his anxiety for Lycophron faded
before this unlooked-for sorrow. Nikander’s two sons
were only by some physical chance his children. This
girl was the child of his mind and heart. She loved
what he loved, hated what he hated. She was his
nearest of kin. His own! Why had he not known it
before?</p>

<p>At last, as Theria’s wide-open eyes half closed, he
tried to believe she slept. So he lay down on a couch
near at hand while the old slave Baltè watched.</p>

<p>It was full morning when Baltè woke him.</p>

<p>“Karamanor and Agis are in the andron to speak
with you.”</p>

<p>These were the young kinsmen whom Nikander had
sent in pursuit of Lycophron. Nikander rose and
went to hear what he must hear.</p>

<p>The two young men waited solemnly.</p>

<p>“It was midnight, Nikander, when we came up
with the spies on the north road,” said young Karamanor
gently. “They gave battle so quick that we
had just time to fend ourselves even though we so
outnumbered them. And Lycophron, even though
we called and kept calling to him to come over to our
side, that we had only come to save him, Lycophron
laughed us to scorn. And, oh, Nikander, he fought
splendidly, fiercely, like a wild boar. And so he fell.
Two of the spies fell. The rest fled to the hills.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span></p>

<p>“He was fearless always,” said Nikander in a low
voice.</p>

<p>The young man put his arm pityingly over his
uncle’s shoulder. He could not know that just now
Nikander felt only relief in the death of his son.</p>

<p>“We took an oath among us, we kinsmen,” said
Karamanor. “All of us, an oath not to tell this thing.
We will say that he fell in a skirmish with the Persians.
Men are too troubled now to think. His absence will
not be marked. Our words will be believed, if any of
us, after the Persian onslaught, be left alive for beliefs
or doubtings. Can we do anything further for you,
Nikander?”</p>

<p>“No,” said Nikander quietly. “May the Son of
Leto bless you for saving my son’s honour. I must
go now and tell his mother.”</p>

<p>Dryas, who had been playing the lyre at Theria’s
bedside, had stopped playing when his father withdrew.
He sat awestruck, waiting.</p>

<p>Presently Melantho’s death-wail for Lycophron
sounded through the house.</p>

<p>“Oh, look, Baltè,” whispered Dryas, through his
tears. “Poor Theria does not even hear it.”</p>

<p>Baltè bent over her nurseling. “She hears it well
enough,” she answered sadly. “She hears, but she is
too far to care.”</p>

<span class="smaller">TERRIBLE NEWS FROM THERMOPYLÆ</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Theria</span> lay on her couch without change, except
to grow weaker each day. Baltè had her own
remedies. She brought a sieve and suspended
it from the ceiling. Then she whirled it, reciting
all the magic she knew and all the cures. At whatever
cure the sieve came to rest that one she tried. But,
alas, it did no good.</p>

<p>Nikander, in spite of urgent business with the priests,
spent hour upon hour beside his daughter. Sometimes
he himself wondered at his strength of love for a mere
girl. He sat dreaming over her, learning her with a new
intimate vision which led him farther every hour.</p>

<p>Often and again as he looked across to where Melantho
sat he would say:</p>

<p>“Wife, we have not understood this little one of ours,
and now it is too late.”</p>

<p>And Melantho would come around the couch and
timidly kiss her husband’s forehead.</p>

<p>Nikander, after his first keen gratitude to Eëtíon, was
too beaten about by the winds of fate to think of him.
Eëtíon, however, came every day. He was very shy,
very guarded in his inquiries after the Delphic priestess.
His friendship for Dryas and Dryas’s devotion to him
were ample excuse for his coming.</p>

<p>Then on the fourth day of Theria’s illness Delphi
rocked with news as at times it rocked with actual<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
earthquakes. The heralds from the north came running,
crying the news with spent voices:</p>

<p>“Thermopylæ is taken! Thermopylæ is taken by
the Persians!”</p>

<p>Then after they took breath again from their long
run—</p>

<p>“The Spartans are beaten back. The noble three
hundred are killed every man. Leonidas is killed. All,
all is lost. The Persians stole through over the mountain
and attacked us from the rear. Thus they took
the pass. They are free in Hellas now to do their will
upon you. Yes, they are marching hither. They are
already in the land of Daulis. They are not forty
miles away.”</p>

<p>The trembling Delphians were mute with horror.</p>

<p>“But the fleet,” pursued Nikander, “was the fleet
also destroyed?”</p>

<p>Upon this the heralds had better news to tell.</p>

<p>“Oh, the fleet, wonderful! The gods themselves!
Never was known such a storm. Three days it lasted,
oh, Delphians. Rain, torrents of rain, now in midsummer
when we never have rain. Wind! Oh, such wind
that it strewed the Persian ships in heaps along the
shore—windrows of ships and drowned Persians. But
our ships, the Athenians were safe in the Eubœan strait.
Not one was lost in the storm and very few by battle.
Well said your Oracle: ‘Pray to the winds.’”</p>

<p>Nikander, his heart swelling with joy and pride, began
to see dimly that miracles can happen in spite of sacrilege
and in other than accepted ways.</p>

<p>“The Athenians?” he asked. “Are they hopeful?”</p>

<p>“Oh, hopeful! Heartened by the god’s help and the
storm’s help. Of course the Persian and Ionian ships
still outnumber them. But the Athenians say that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
some god is on their side. They are ready to fight
again. They are hastening back to Athenian waters for
the fighting.”</p>

<p>But Delphi had no such hope. Delphi was all confusion.
She had no real army even though she was an
independent state. She had only her temple guard.
This guard had been sufficient in ordinary times. For
all Hellas revered Apollo’s temple. No Hellenic state
would dare plunder Apollo’s shrine. But now! Those
hordes of barbarians who knew not the god. From
these the Delphians well knew what to expect.</p>

<p>They hurriedly left the heralds. Everywhere now
were seen men with their families, their slaves, carrying
burdens, some hurrying up toward the mountain, some
hurrying down toward the port of Kirrha. But the
braver citizens stayed with white faces to consult
the Oracle once more.</p>

<p>Nikander, hastening homeward, found these and the
priests already at his door.</p>

<p>“You must give us back the Pythia, Nikander,” spoke
Kobon angrily. “The Oracle must be consulted at once.
Who ever heard of a Pythia being taken home again?”</p>

<p>Nikander pushed through the crowd and stood with
his back to the closed door.</p>

<p>“You may not take her,” he said. “She is dying. She
would die before she reached the tripod.”</p>

<p>“She might not. You know very well, Nikander,
that on the edge of death the Pythia often prophesies
best.”</p>

<p>Timon took Nikander’s arm.</p>

<p>“I am sorry, cousin,” he said, “but you know that
what Kobon says is true. This is no time for a man to
think of his own household. She might save the very
shrine.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>“She cannot save it,” said Nikander stubbornly.
“She has not spoken for four days. She is beyond all
speech. Aristonikè is not so ill as she.”</p>

<p>He closed his eyes for a moment, trying to decide
what he might and might not tell. “My daughter has
no gift of ecstasy,” he ventured. “No oracles come to
her at all.”</p>

<p>“Nikander, what lies! You know the very best of
the oracles have been through her.”</p>

<p>“Aristonikè,” broke in another priest; “Aristonikè
prophesies nothing but ill.”</p>

<p>They seized Nikander, held him struggling, while
priests and citizens broke upon the door and rushed
into the house.</p>

<p>“Dryas, Dryas, help me!” Nikander shouted; but if
Dryas was there he did not appear.</p>

<p>Nikander heard Baltè shriek as the priests caught up
her nurseling. Forth they rushed again, his daughter
white as death in a stalwart priest’s arms. So they
hurried up the road toward the temple.</p>

<p>Then Nikander from his house saw temple slaves
running to meet the priests, saw them all stop together.
They crowded in confusion. Then from the confusion
came the same temple slaves and to Nikander’s amazement
they were bearing Theria in their arms, bringing
her home again. The priests and citizens ran onward
frantically up to the temple.</p>

<p>Nikander wrested himself free and ran to meet the
slaves. They gave her carefully into his arms.</p>

<p>“She is dead, already dead?” he whispered.</p>

<p>“No—no, Master,” they assured him.</p>

<p>He did not pause to find out what had happened but
hurried back with Theria to her couch, where on a
sudden he could do nothing but weep and wring his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
hands. Baltè had to compose both her patient and
him, assuring him over and over again that no harm
had been done.</p>

<p>It was Dryas who, later, hurrying home from the
Precinct, told Nikander what had happened.</p>

<p>“Aristonikè,” he announced, “passed into ecstasy
suddenly without any rites and prophesied wonderful
things. They carried her to the tripod even while she
prophesied. The crowd of priests coming from our
house reached the adytum just in time to hear her cry
out:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“‘The god will care for his own.’</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Then she fell forward into old Akeretos’s arms and
was dead.”</p>

<p>Nikander shuddered. “Poor child,” he said, “poor,
poor little girl.”</p>

<p>“But, Father, think what that means!” said Dryas.
“‘The god will care for his own’!”</p>

<p>Nikander put his hand on Dryas’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, my son, you are right, but had any one
asked a question? How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“But, Father, don’t you know that Akeretos himself
has been asking a question for days? He is so old,
I suppose he knows the Oracle better than any of us.
He says that in his youth this method was tried and
answer received beyond all hope.</p>

<p>“But what did he do?” asked the dazed Nikander.</p>

<p>“He made sacrifice right in front of the Pythia House,
not as usual on the Great Altar. The question which he
was to ask was: ‘What shall we do to save the treasures
of the god? Shall we hide them in the hills?’ But
he repeated not this question at all, but instead, the
while he was sacrificing, he kept repeating to himself<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
the answer which he desired—thinking only of this
answer: ‘The god will care for his own. The sacred
things must not be touched by mortal hands. The
god will care for his own.’ And sure enough within the
house, locked within it indeed, Aristonikè awoke from
sleep with a low cry and began to say those very words:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Touch not the sacred things,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">The god will care for his own!”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“So when Tuchè came running out to tell him, Akeretos
brought Aristonikè forth to the tripod.”</p>

<p>Dryas paused, taking a long breath.</p>

<p>“And now all the Delphians say there is no need to
stay to defend our Delphi. We may all flee to the
mountains while the god alone fights for us. We of the
household also must make haste to go.”</p>

<p>It was almost a pleading look which poor Dryas bent
upon his father.</p>

<p>“You can go if you will, Dryas. For my part, I
shall not leave the shrine.”</p>

<p>Again Dryas took a long breath. His cheek paled
and he looked down, then he said:</p>

<p>“I might have known you would answer that. I
shall stay with you.”</p>

<span class="smaller">AT EËTÍON’S CALL</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">What</span> Dryas reported was true. The Delphians
were deserting their town, whether
from great faith or great fear, who could say?
Their temple guard could not be called an army. It
seemed as vain to wait for the Persian as to wait for
the onsweep of a flood at the breaking of a dam. The
dam had broken at Thermopylæ and the flood was
coming.</p>

<p>Men sent their wives and children across the gulf to
Corinth and thence to Achaia, and when there were no
more boats others sent them to Amphissa in Locris.
The men of Delphi hurried up into Mount Parnassos,
to the Korykian cave and to other fastnesses known
only to themselves.</p>

<p>Only about sixty people were left in Delphi and of
course the armed temple guard.</p>

<p>Nikander sought out Melantho.</p>

<p>“Dear wife,” he said, “I have chartered a little boat
to take you and your own special slaves to Corinth.
It will be a long journey for you, but do not be afraid.
You will be safe in Achaia.”</p>

<p>“And Theria?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Would God I could send her!” said Nikander
brokenly. “But she is too ill to be moved. She is
weaker than ever since that terrible experience with the
priests. Even were she strong enough, the priests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
would not allow her to go. The Pythia is not allowed
to go away.”</p>

<p>He looked up, wondering at Melantho’s silence. Melantho
was a timid creature and the most submissive
wife in the world.</p>

<p>“Am I like the kegs of cheese that they carry up to
the cave?” she asked huskily.</p>

<p>“Kegs of cheese!” asked Nikander blankly.</p>

<p>“Am I goods and chattels, not even so much alive as
the dogs of Delphi? The dogs stay.”</p>

<p>Great Paian! Melantho was angry. Nikander had
never seen her angry in his life.</p>

<p>She stamped her foot.</p>

<p>“I will not go,” she cried. “I’ll turn over the boat
and swamp it if you put me in it. I will not go when—when
all my dear ones stay.”</p>

<p>Then she melted with streaming tears. Poor Melantho!
After this little outburst she would have
done anything Nikander required.</p>

<p>But Nikander took her in his arms, loving her as he
had never thought to do.</p>

<p>“My dear Melantho,” he said. “I begin to think I
am the stupidest man in Delphi. Of course you shall
stay.”</p>

<p>It was no easy matter to care for two helpless women
at such a time, but Nikander was glad that Melantho
was to stay. As for Baltè, nations might rise or fall,
she had one care only, to watch her nurseling. And
now Baltè was busy with new plans. She had long ago
given up her sieve and taken it back to the kitchen
where she gave it a kick of scorn.</p>

<p>Theria was steadily growing weaker, but her eyes as
Baltè studied them looked not quite so glassy, not
quite so blank as at first. Sometimes Baltè actually<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span>
saw in them a great sadness. When any one came into
the door, Theria’s eyes would slowly, painfully direct
themselves thither, seeming to search, and when the
search was made this deep sadness or disappointment
would settle upon her face. And once, instead of relapsing
into blankness after their pitiful searching, the
dark eyes closed and tears stole down between the lids.</p>

<p>What did her child want? Baltè asked herself this
question. Asked Theria every question she knew.
For while Nikander could not bring himself to speak to
that strange, blank face of Theria, Baltè talked and
asked and crooned as any nurse crooned to her baby.</p>

<p>Though to all her asking Baltè received no reply,
yet at last she thought she knew her darling’s wish.</p>

<p>The next day she met Nikander in the outer aula.</p>

<p>“Master,” she said, “I know now what little mistress
wants.”</p>

<p>“Great Heaven! has she spoken?” asked Nikander.</p>

<p>“No, Master, but her eyes speak to me.”</p>

<p>“They do not to me,” said Nikander sorrowfully.</p>

<p>“Oh, Master, ye must not be wroth with little mistress
if I tell ye that she loves that good youth that found
her on the mountain. Don’t ye blame her for it. She
is a human child and Eëtíon loves her so dearly. She
wants to see him, Master. She wants to see him.”</p>

<p>“Poor Baltè, you cannot know that.”</p>

<p>Baltè told what she had seen.</p>

<p>“You forget,” said Nikander, “that your little mistress
is priestess. It would be absolutely improper.”</p>

<p>“She’s goin’ soon where there’s no proper nor unproper,”
retorted Baltè in her broadest Doric. “An’
if she goes, what harm to gi’ her this wee bit of joy
beforehand? An’ if she dies for lack of it, then it’s ye
will be her murderer.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span></p>

<p>Baltè was determined to supplicate her master with
the unrefusable supplication if she could get consent
no other way.</p>

<p>But at this moment came Eëtíon, all excited over
what the priests had done.</p>

<p>“It’s ye I am talkin’ o’, young man,” announced
Baltè. “The master here says ‘no’. But the little
mistress is pinin’ away for a sight of ye. She is thot.”</p>

<p>“Is she better? Did she ask—oh, Nikander——”
pleaded Eëtíon.</p>

<p>“Baltè is dreaming. Go back to your little mistress,
Baltè.”</p>

<p>But Baltè stood her ground. “If the lad calls her
she’ll answer him. Mark ye that.”</p>

<p>“Will she answer? Do you really believe she will
answer?” asked Eëtíon, his lips quivering with the
memory of Theria’s unanswering silence on the mountain.</p>

<p>“O love o’ Leto, stop askin’! Come!” said Baltè.</p>

<p>And Nikander suddenly consented.</p>

<p>Eëtíon came in with awe as one comes into a death
chamber.</p>

<p>He knelt by her couch, laid his brown, trembling
hands over her two white ones, and, leaning close, called
her—once, and again.</p>

<p>Then an amazing thing happened: There passed
slowly from off the dark lakes of eyes something as it
were a shadow, leaving them sweet and sensible, leaving
in them an ardent, dreamy look.</p>

<p>Then the dream gave place to lovely awakening,
which was Theria’s self—a surprised, outreaching love.</p>

<p>Her lips framed a word: “Eëtíon.”</p>

<p>Eëtíon forgot all about him. He gathered her close,
kissing her, calling her. And now she spoke quite<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
aloud, calling him in return with names and epithets as
dear.</p>

<p>“You have not forgotten me,” he was saying, “Oh,
I thought you had forgotten.”</p>

<p>“Never, never. I could not forget you in Acheron,”
was her murmured answer.</p>

<p>“Speak to me, me, also, my daughter,” pleaded
Nikander.</p>

<p>“Yes, Father. Dear, dear Father,” came her answer.
No trace of fear or unaffection for all his angry words
which had sent her away. She reached out her arms
to him like a returning child.</p>

<p>Baltè clapped her hands with loud sobs and shoutings.
She, too, must kiss and rejoice over her little one.</p>

<p>“Baltè,” said Nikander solemnly, “may the gods in
my age give me such wisdom as yours. For my part
I shall never question yours again. So now, dear Baltè,
go and fetch Melantho.”</p>

<p>Melantho came, and Dryas. One would have
thought to hear the rejoicings in the house that no
Persians were anywhere in Greece. Then presently
Baltè was for sending them all away. They must not
tire her darling.</p>

<p>Theria clung to her lover’s hands. “Will you come
again, Eëtíon?” she pleaded. “Say you will come
again.”</p>

<p>Nikander doubtfully opened his lips but Baltè
waved a warning finger.</p>

<p>“Indeed an’ he will, my darlin’,” she said with
authority. “Old Baltè will see that he does.”</p>

<p>And Eëtíon, leaping up, kissed Baltè’s withered cheek,
at which Theria’s first sweet laugh was heard.</p>

<span class="smaller">EËTÍON AND NIKANDER</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Nikander</span> and Eëtíon went out hand in hand
as was the custom of Greek men who loved
each other.</p>

<p>“Dear youth, what can I say to you?” spoke Nikander.
“You have returned to me my two children,
my son and now my daughter.”</p>

<p>“I love your daughter. I love your daughter,”
spoke out Eëtíon passionately. “Now you know it.
I want her for my wife.”</p>

<p>“Would you could have her,” was Nikander’s answer.</p>

<p>“But can I not?” questioned the unreasonable
youth.</p>

<p>“My dear boy, you know she is priestess. I wish
Apollo had killed me before I made her priestess.”</p>

<p>Eëtíon clenched his hands. “She shall not go back
to the Pythia House. She is too splendid, too free-minded.”</p>

<p>“She shall certainly never go upon the tripod,” responded
Nikander. “I will promise you that.”</p>

<p>Eëtíon paced the room in bitter distress. “How
could you make her priestess?” he said, forgetting all
kindness. “How could you take away her last chance
for action and noble living? You don’t deserve to be
Theria’s father.”</p>

<p>“Indeed I do not,” was Nikander’s sorrowful rejoinder.
He laid quieting hands upon the youth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span></p>

<p>“We are in dark days, Eëtíon. Perhaps not one of
us will be alive to-morrow. Let us not grieve over
what may not in any case come to pass.”</p>

<p>“The hope would be so much,” said Eëtíon with
sudden tears. Eëtíon’s fortunate beauty made each
emotion of his appealing, whether bowing the head in
grief or lifting it with sudden smile. Nikander loved
him for his grief and, forgetting his own bitter share in it,
set about earnestly to calm him.</p>

<p>“My dear boy,” he said, “in the coming battle
you will forget this love for a maid. It will be unimportant
in the light of great deeds. Men love other
men with such devotion and companioning but hardly
a maid.”</p>

<p>“But this is Theria,” said Eëtíon childishly.</p>

<p>“Yes,” mused the father proudly. “It is Theria.”</p>

<p>“Do you know,” went on Eëtíon in a low voice, “I
thought she was a goddess the first time I saw her. I
really did. It was in the Precinct of Athena. I was
weeping aloud with misery because my work of four
years was brought to naught and I was pushed back
into slavery, for I had been long in bondage. And
Theria came leaping down the hill in the morning light.
She spoke to me. (Oh, such wonderful kindness to
which I had long been a stranger.) Then afterward,
O Nikander, she saved me. Braving all sorts of
punishment, she saved me. Could a man have done
more than that? Is it any wonder that I love her?”</p>

<p>Nikander felt it his duty to dissuade the youth from
a love so hopeless—but he suddenly had no word to say.
That love seemed so sweet and right and pure. He
was proud that this daughter of his had called it forth.</p>

<p>The youth went on:</p>

<p>“We of Argos are worshippers of Hera. There is a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
saying among us that the ‘Souls who follow Hera desire
a love of royal quality.’ Hera cherishes the lawful
union of man and woman.”</p>

<p>Nikander’s head bowed lower. He had forgotten
this further obstacle that Eëtíon was a metic. The
union was impossible. From every side, impossible.
With grieving face Nikander turned and left Eëtíon
where he stood.</p>

<span class="smaller">THERIA TELLS HER VISION</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Nikander’s</span> care was now to save as much of
his household treasure as might be. Before
this time his anxiety over his children had so
beset him that he cared little whether anything else was
saved or not. But now he set slaves to packing the
family records, the old Nikander drinking vessels of
gold and silver, and the stores of corn, oil, and wine.
Theria’s storeroom soon bore a changed aspect.</p>

<p>Then the most faithful slaves he sent with these
things up into the mountain to the Korykian cave.</p>

<p>But even with this business Nikander found time to
go ever and again to Theria’s bedside to stop perhaps
but for a single caress or word or question.</p>

<p>Theria was sitting up in her couch and keeping poor
Baltè busy running for this and that to occupy her.</p>

<p>“Father!” she said, holding up her five fingers
brightly as he came toward her. “This is the fifth
time you have come to me. I have counted.”</p>

<p>“Bless your heart, child, why do you count my
visits?”</p>

<p>“Because they are my treasures,” she answered. “I
used to see you only twice in the day and the time between
was so long and stupid.”</p>

<p>Nikander bent and kissed her, not quite able to
speak. He determined that this daughter should
never again lack his companionship. Then a swift<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
stab of memory reminded him how soon she must be
returned to the Pythia House, where he could see her
not at all.</p>

<p>He sat down beside her.</p>

<p>Baltè, seeing that he was there to watch in her stead,
hurried off on some errand.</p>

<p>Baltè was no sooner gone than Theria bent near him.</p>

<p>“Father,” she said in awed tones, “I was not ill. I
was held in dumbness by what I saw in the mountain.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Daughter,” he responded.</p>

<p>“The god crossed my path. Phœbus Apollo. I saw
him!”</p>

<p>Even though Nikander had guessed this, he was
startled at her telling.</p>

<p>“Oh, Father, so living beautiful he was, with the dawn
in his face and power shining from all of him! All the
statues in the Precinct should be broken. They are
not my god.”</p>

<p>“We must leave them,” said her father gently,
“for those of us who cannot see.”</p>

<p>“First,” she went on, “I saw only a golden light upon
my path, which followed me and frightened me.”</p>

<p>Even as she spoke, her eyes grew starry and her
father caught her shoulder, shaking her.</p>

<p>“No, do not tell me, child. Be still. The dumbness
may come again.”</p>

<p>“No, it will not,” she smiled. “Apollo promised.”</p>

<p>“Great heaven, did he speak?”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes.” Then she told as near as she remembered
the words of the message. Oracle it could hardly be
called, as it was a revelation for her alone.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Theria, daughter of Delphi, begone from my temple. My bow
shall not hurt thee, Nay, for I love thee. I shall be able without
thee. I shall care for my own.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span></p>

<p>And how the god had turned and shot his terrible shaft
away from her over Mount Parnassos toward the north.</p>

<p>Nikander was uplifted, overwhelmed. He went
hastily and fetched tablet and stylus and wrote it down
for the temple records. He was hopeful, fairly trembling
from what he guessed this message might mean for
his daughter’s future. Theria herself thought only
of the god’s forgiveness.</p>

<p>“Apollo said that he loved me,” she repeated. “He
said it. And he laughed at me because I wanted him
to slay me.”</p>

<p>What would the priests think of this message of the
god? Nikander hardly dared hope that they would put
upon it the interpretation which he so desired. No
pythia had ever been freed from priesthood. Indeed,
if he told the vision, must it not bring them to a knowledge
of her false oracle, the punishment of which would
be death? His face grew set with thought. But yes,
he would risk even that fate in the hope of what the
god’s message might do for her. He kissed his child
and hurried out to find Timon and the other priests.</p>

<p>How changed already were the streets, empty of
folk. The houses closed and locked or left open in the
haste of flight, showing the vacant rooms.</p>

<p>He found Timon in the Precinct. But Timon was
wholly indifferent to Theria’s part of the god’s message.
It was the hurtling shaft of Phœbus which interested
him. “It was shot toward Parnassos, you say? That
is a good omen,” he asserted. Nikander could not be
sure. But he soon saw that the priests were too
beset now with their fears and instant business to consider
Theria’s status as priestess—the matter so dear to
his heart.</p>

<p>“A party of Phokian peasants,” said Timon, “came<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
into town this morning, fleeing from the Persians.
Their tidings are horrible. The armies have overrun
all the land of Phokis. They are killing men, outraging
women, burning towns. Drymos is burned. Charadra,
Amphikaia, Neon, Elateia, and many more. They
have burnt the temple of Apollo at Abai. Do you not
think, Nikander, that that may mean perhaps that they
are headed the other way toward Athens and will pass
us by?”</p>

<p>For Abai was on the eastern road.</p>

<p>“I do not,” said Nikander. “If they burnt the
god’s temple at Abai, they will not spare his temple at
Delphi. The Persian prisoners are telling that Xerxes
the king knows more exactly what is treasured in our
temples than he knows the treasures in his own palace.
He will not spare Delphi.”</p>

<p>“I have sent my wife, daughters, and slaves to
Achaia,” said Timon. “If I am killed and you spared,
Nikander, you will send them word?”</p>

<p>Something in Nikander’s face stopped him.</p>

<p>“I am sorry,” he added, “that you may not send
Theria away. No priest would allow it. The Oracle
without a pythia at such a time as this!”</p>

<p>“My wife is staying, too,” replied Nikander, not
without pride.</p>

<p>“Then I advise you to bring all up within the Precinct
walls as soon as possible,” urged his kinsman.</p>

<span class="smaller">REFUGE IN THE PRECINCT</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">In Delphi</span>, where all was danger, the Precinct was
perhaps the most dangerous place, yet Nikander
with his faith did not think this, nor would any
other Greek think it.</p>

<p>He hurried home and sought Melantho.</p>

<p>“We must go up to the Precinct at once,” he said.
“Make ready as soon as you can.”</p>

<p>In an hour’s time they were all gathered with the
slaves in the men’s aula. Bundles of clothes and
little treasures were in their hands. Some of the slaves
were weeping, but the family stood in that awed silence
which precedes departure.</p>

<p>Theria seemed even yet but distantly touched by the
world’s alarms. The calm of the vision mood was still
upon her. Nikander believed that she would never
wholly recede from this but would always retain that
serenity of mind which marks one who has beheld a god.</p>

<p>Eëtíon came in asking for Dryas, but, seeing Theria
there in her cloak, of course forgot all else. Theria
was shy, but Eëtíon took her in his arms quite frankly
and kissed her. Nikander looked upon them with an
aching heart, thinking how many a hedge shut out
happiness from these two.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Dryas was pacing nervously to and fro
under the balcony. Nikander averted his eyes. He
could not bear that his son should be in the pangs of
personal fear. But Eëtíon went directly to Dryas.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span></p>

<p>“Dryas,” he said, “would it not be well for you to
take a last survey of all the rooms to see that nothing is
left? Do it quickly, for all is ready.”</p>

<p>Dryas hurried off with just the sense of relief which
Eëtíon had meant to afford him.</p>

<p>And as Eëtíon once more stood at Theria’s side,
Nikander said to him:</p>

<p>“I want you, Eëtíon, to be with us in the Precinct as
a son of the house. A son could not be more dear.”</p>

<p>Dryas returned.</p>

<p>“I’ve been through the rooms,” he said brightly.
“There’s nothing worth while but this old thing in the
storeroom.”</p>

<p>It was Lycophron’s old lyre which Theria had used
all these years.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, yes, I want it,” said Theria, taking it in her
arms.</p>

<p>“Are we all ready now?” asked Nikander.</p>

<p>Theria began to look around. Her face flushed,
then paled. Then she asked the question which Nikander
had been dreading.</p>

<p>“Where is Lycophron, Father? Why isn’t he with
us?”</p>

<p>Nikander put his arm about her and led her away
from the others.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she said in a frightened voice, “I remember
now. Father, did he go clean away—away from us?”</p>

<p>“My dear child, he is dead,” said Nikander, without
tears. Then he told her of the kind oath of the kinsmen.
Theria, too, must keep that secret.</p>

<p>But she only clung to him, sobbing. Eëtíon came to
comfort her and before long she was able to go with
them out toward the Precinct.</p>

<p>It was natural that the few remaining Delphians<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
should cling as close as possible to the Great Temple.
Nikander saw to his regret that the only obvious
refuge for Theria was the Pythia House. It was the
only building besides the temple itself upon the temple
platform. Into the old prison place she must go.</p>

<p>But Melantho went in with her. And there was also
an old blind woman, too feeble for fight, and a young
mother borne on a litter with her hour-old child.
Nikander was allowed to go in and out as the one upon
whom all depended, and in front of the house Eëtíon and
Dryas kept guard.</p>

<p>The great danger had broken down all conventions.</p>

<p>Before nightfall Nikander took Melantho and Theria
out through a small gate of the Precinct wall, which was
just back of the Pythia House. He gave Theria the
gate key. Then he led them up a little path amid the
talus of the cliff to where there was a tomb against the
hillside. Nikander had caused a narrow hole to be
made in the side of the tomb where a thick laurel
bush would hide it. The door of the tomb itself
presented a sealed front. Hither Nikander had
brought provisions and here—so near by and yet secure—he
told Theria she must come with her mother should
the Persians enter the Precinct.</p>

<p>As they turned back toward the Pythia House he
gave Theria a small sharp dagger.</p>

<p>“You will not use it too soon I know, for you are
brave. You will know the moment if it comes. It is
for both of you.”</p>

<p>With a strange sense that all this was quite a usual
thing to do, they came back through the gate.</p>

<p>At twilight Nikander, passing Theria’s door, saw her
with her head down, weeping quietly. He came and
sat beside her, questioning her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span></p>

<p>“It is Lycophron,” she said through her tears. “Oh,
Father, I loved him! He was so good to me!”</p>

<p>Now Nikander’s grief for Lycophron had been bitter
and lonely. He could hardly share it with Dryas, and
Melantho knew nothing of the truth. So the grief
haunted him like a hovering Erinyes.</p>

<p>“We must remind ourselves that it is best as it is,”
he said dryly.</p>

<p>“Yes, best for him, but I miss his goodness. No
matter who is kind to me I shall miss <em>his</em> kindness.”</p>

<p>“Was he so kind to you?” said Nikander. For there
in the house, as so often happens, the father had not
guessed the bond between these youngsters.</p>

<p>“Yes. Always he would stop and tell me the news
I was hungry to know. He would spend time upon me
when no one else thought of me. And, Father, when I
was here dying of loneliness Lycophron sent Baltè to
me—I know it was disobedient, but it was so kind. He
gave Baltè money to use for bribes so she could get in and
as if that were not enough, he sent me messages, just the
ones that he knew I wanted most. He had a heart of
gold!”</p>

<p>Suddenly Nikander bowed his head low in a passion
of weeping. The unexpected praise—the unexpected
bringing back of his son into the sweetness of the family
life, broke him down completely.</p>

<p>Theria threw her arms about him, frightened at her
thoughtlessness.</p>

<p>“Oh, Father, I should have thought of you before I
said it,” she faltered.</p>

<p>“Dear child, you have given me something that I
thought was for ever lost,” he answered.</p>

<p>He went out readier for the hard to-morrow than he
had deemed possible.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE PERSIAN COMES</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">The</span> night was deepening. Eëtíon and Dryas,
fully armed, stood guard together on the temple
platform not far from the Pythia House. Nikander,
at their insistence, had gone within the house.
He was sleeping, worn out by his anxieties for children
and state.</p>

<p>“Do you think,” spoke Dryas in a low voice, “that
even now the host may go on toward Athens and leave
us out of their march?”</p>

<p>“It is possible,” returned Eëtíon. “The Persians
have no time to lose in the direction of Athens. Their
marching to Abai is a good sign for Delphi.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Delphi was armed for the Medes’ immediate
coming. Most of the Precinct guards were
stationed at the great gate. The small gates facing
the highway had a few men each, but the gates in the
back wall were entirely without guard—a pitiful preparation
truly for the coming of a hundred myriads of men.</p>

<p>It was a showing forth of the Delphians’ despair.
The best they could do was so far short of adequate
defence that this seemed nor less nor more.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as the two friends stood there in the night,
they saw a glow break on the far heights east of Pleistos
Valley, very red and brightening, brightening!</p>

<p>“Look,” said Dryas, between lips which hardly
parted. “Eëtíon, that light up there!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span></p>

<p>One of the old temple guardsmen approached.</p>

<p>“That will be up Daulis way,” he said. “They’ve
set fire to Daulis.”</p>

<p>Neither Dryas nor Eëtíon made comment. They
knew only too well what it meant.</p>

<p>The Persians were heading for Delphi! And were
now not two hours away!</p>

<p>Dryas hurriedly sent a slave to fetch wine.</p>

<p>“Don’t do that,” advised Eëtíon. “The wine will
help you now, but later it will weaken your arm.”</p>

<p>Dryas clapped his hands together in pitiful misery.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you hate me, kick me out for the dog I
am? Why did you ever try to save me?”</p>

<p>“Hush, hush,” said Eëtíon. He laid his hand on
Dryas’s arm. “Your father must not hear you.”</p>

<p>“Why, Eëtíon! Your hand is cold as ice.”</p>

<p>“Of course it is, foolish boy, do you suppose other
men are made of wood and only you feel what must be
hid?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Eëtíon, forgive—forgive me,” pleaded the
emotional Dryas.</p>

<p>“This inaction now, this waiting,” said Eëtíon
soberly, “is the hardest part of the battle. I have not
been in battles myself, but old soldiers tell me so.
Think, Dryas, you have father, mother, sister to protect.
I have no one I can call my own—and no city.”</p>

<p>“Father would give you Theria,” whispered Dryas,
“if he could get her free. And oh, Eëtíon, I know he
feels that Delphi is your city. I feel that Delphi is
your city.”</p>

<p>All night long Dryas had been assailed by a horrible
picture of his own death. His highly developed imagination
swept the thing through him like a reality. It
was a spear-thrust in his side, keen and fatal, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
grinning face of a Persian triumphing over him.
Dryas tried to think other thoughts, but this thing returned
again and again, sometimes with an actual pain
where the weapon was thrust in. Dryas could have conquered
it but for the fear-producing chant which old
Akeretos kept up near the Great Altar.</p>

<p>All night long the old prophet moved to and fro—making
sacrifices, trying omens of all sorts, seeing
portents where none were, an eerie, aged figure in the
starlight with his white beard wagging and his hands
lifted on high.</p>

<p>Dawn began to break in the slow beautiful way as if
the day were to be all gentleness instead of the most
dreadful day these hills had ever known.</p>

<p>At full morning Nikander came out refreshed, to
share with Dryas and Eëtíon the morning meal. He
was in armour, for Nikander was yet in full fighting
strength.</p>

<p>They were eating in silence when Dryas with a cry
jumped to his feet.</p>

<p>“Look, look,” he said. “There on the uppermost
road!”</p>

<p>The road from Daulis, winding down the distant
mountains among the crags, was several times visible
and lost again ere it reached Delphi. Now on its
highest, farthest stretch the Delphians saw moving
spots, like groups of ants, carrying ant burdens. Even
as the Delphians were gazing, the spots became a
solid mass, which filled the road from end to end of its
visible stretch.</p>

<p>They could not tell now that the mass was moving.
Simply the road at that point was curiously black.</p>

<p>Dryas’s cry brought Theria from the house. She
noted the looks and gestures of the men, then stole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
over to Eëtíon’s side. The others were too intent to
notice what she did.</p>

<p>“What is it?” she asked.</p>

<p>He pointed out the black stretch of distant road and
she knew by the horror in his face what it meant.</p>

<p>Eëtíon was not a natural soldier. Only training and
Hellas-love had made him such. But now with Theria
beside him, the horror in his face changed to iron resolve.
Theria hardly recognized him as he turned
toward her.</p>

<p>“Theria, there is no chance for Delphi now,” he
whispered. “Your father has told me of your hiding
place. I shall keep as near to it as I may, but the gods
only know whither the battle will thrust me. If I
escape, I’ll come to you. I’ll speak outside a pass-word,
‘<i>Hera basileia</i>,’ because Hera is my goddess at home.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she whispered, clinging to his hand, “but add
‘<i>Paian will care for his own</i>.’”</p>

<p>He could not but catch the hope which lived with her,
the peace which her vision had left upon her.</p>

<p>He bent and kissed her, almost believing that they
should both be saved.</p>

<p>Only Dryas saw him do it, Dryas, whom Eëtíon
had forgotten in this moment of snatched joy, Dryas,
whose struggle had now grown so intense that it seemed
every moment he must break away. The hills were
still there to hide in, so near, so possible a refuge.
Was it worth while standing there to be slaughtered?
This was no battling for Delphi. It was foolishness.
They were all of them fools—fools—fools!</p>

<p>Now Nikander came to him. “Son,” he said reassuringly,
“I am thankful you are here.”</p>

<p>Dryas did not answer, for at this moment a low exclamation
broke from all the little group at once.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span></p>

<p>The Persians had emerged on the lower road!</p>

<p>Now could be caught the moving colour of their
garments, flashes of bronze, as shields glanced the
light, and now a moving bulk of shivering glitter as a
host of upright spears advanced.</p>

<p>Nearer, nearer! Well seen now at the foot of
Delphi’s own cliffs, well seen at the foot of Phaidriades,
well seen below in the Precinct of Athena Forethought
in Delphi village!</p>

<p>Pointed caps, huge wicker shields, tall lances, these
were the Medes themselves. Behind them, a curious
barbarian folk in hooded mantles, and oh, dear Paian,
what are these? Men black as ebony, clad in skins of
leopard and lion, carrying bows twice as tall as themselves.
Some have woolly heads, others have heads
not human at all but horse heads, with upright ears
and flowing manes. Behind these come tribes and
tribes and tribes, greedy, pitiless, devouring.</p>

<p>Look far up the mountain road! Every visible loop
is filled back to where it is lost in distance. Oh, Apollon,
surely you have forgotten! Son of Leto, you are far
off this day, joying among your Olympians. Our
Delphi is naught to you!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>What happened now can hardly be believed, but it
is recorded by the father of history and later writers
bear testimony to it.</p>

<p>This had happened time and time again in the past
to the hurt of Delphi, why not happen this once to her
help? Herodotus says it did happen.</p>

<p>Eëtíon, Dryas, Theria, Nikander heard
groan as if the earth, old Gê herself, had spoken. A
little bird singing in the laurel bush near by stopped
its song and leaped aloft with frightened cries. Then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
like a wave on the sea-beach the temple platform beneath
their feet pitched forward. They saw the wave
motion run onward upon the earth, down the glen, and
to the farther hillside where the forests received it
shivering. The Delphian group on the platform
stumbled wildly forward. Old Akeretos fell flat before
his altar. The altar itself shook and the Great Temple
rocked as if about to begin an elephantine dance.</p>

<p>The earth movement was distinct, outward from
Parnassos toward the valley.</p>

<p>Theria, looking up at Phaidriades, saw the cliffs nodding
solemnly to each other as if to say: “Ay—so be it.”</p>

<p>Then huge rocks flew hurtling from their summits
high overhead and down upon the road, down crashing
upon the moving Persian host!</p>

<p>There was a great and bitter cry, death, terror, confusion.</p>

<p>The Persian army fled this way and that. Forward
toward the village—downward into the Forethought
Precinct where the avenging rocks of Delphi followed
them.</p>

<p>Everywhere the mountains sent up clouds and clouds
of dust. In the distance upon the distant armies
poured down avalanches of earth and rolling stones
and dust—more dust!</p>

<p>Of the little group on the temple platform Dryas
was the first to get upon his feet.</p>

<p>“Hail, Paian; Alala, Alala!”</p>

<p>He shouted the old Dorian war cry and, waiting not
for Eëtíon nor his father, charged down the Sacred Way.
His spear was forward-ready; his shield weightless
upon his arm. His hair streamed from his helmet upon
the wind. He was light-footed as a god. So might
Achilles have swept into battle after his days of wrath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span></p>

<p>Eëtíon and Nikander, with a score of temple guards,
leaped after him. The great gates had already been
flung open by the earth’s motion.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>“Ai, Ai! look up! Look up. Behold our avenging
god!”</p>

<p>It was old Akeretos shouting in a frenzy which
Theria had to obey. Her upward glance caught the
bronze votive chariot of Gelon just as it toppled from
its lofty eyrie in the cliffside. Down it came! Chariot,
horses, victor and charioteer, banging on jutting rock
and crag with grand clangour, a divine and shattering
noise.</p>

<p>“And there happened to the Persians yet greater
portents,” says the historian. “Two men in full
armour and of stature more than human followed
them slaying and pursuing.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile Dryas in the midst of battle knew only
that he was struggling amid a sea of men. Persian
warriors, who in spite of their terror of the supernatural
happenings, fought the pursuing Delphians
desperately and tried thus to preserve their fleeing
hordes.</p>

<p>Dryas dealt blow after blow, stroke after stroke.
Better yet, he received wounds uncaring, and with
every wound, every stroke, the gods gave him manhood
and courage.</p>

<p>Surely after tasting so sweet a thing as courage he
could not ever go back to cowardice. The Nikander
in him grew to full stature in these moments.</p>

<p>Oh, heaven! Eëtíon had fallen. Dryas rushed to
him, holding over him the shield while he fought.
More wounds were here. Then, Paian be praised,
Eëtíon struggled to his feet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span></p>

<p>Where were they now? Out beyond Delphi, a mile
out on the Daulis road and the Persians, Assyrians,
Arabians, Ethiopians in full retreat.</p>

<p>Oh, what was Dryas doing now? Struggling, shouting,
brandishing his arms in foolish wildness, while
Eëtíon and Nikander adjured him to keep still, that
all was past.</p>

<span class="smaller">THANKFULNESS</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Surely</span> never was a happier, humbler band of
victors than these who now returned along the
road to the Precinct. Nikander and Eëtíon
bearing Dryas on a litter, the temple guardsmen now
laughing aloud with some recollection of battle triumph,
now awed into silence, as one of them told of
the divine shoutings he had heard, or the terrible
dealing of those rocks which fell from on high upon the
enemy.</p>

<p>The other Delphians who had rushed down from
hiding in the hills kept silence. Every one of them
was wishing that he had stayed with the guard in the
Precinct.</p>

<p>Outside the gate Theria met them with outstretched
arms and tears of joy. She kissed Eëtíon and her
father, and knelt down by Dryas’s litter, bending over
him in love.</p>

<p>“Darling Dryas.” Then, “Quick, I must help him.”</p>

<p>Dryas’s face was white with pain, but he caught her
hand.</p>

<p>“I am safe now,” he whispered. “Really, really
safe!”</p>

<p>He closed his eyes.</p>

<p>“He saved my life,” spoke Eëtíon proudly.</p>

<p>“And fought better than any of us. Oh, my son.
Dear, dear boy!” cried Nikander.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>“I saw him in the fight,” asserted one of the guard.
“That’s true what you say.”</p>

<p>In the entrance portico of the Precinct they set him
down, while Theria sent slaves for water and wine and
other slaves homeward for the remedies of her own.</p>

<p>Soon she was bathing Dryas’s deep wounds, staunching
their flow with the wine, setting the poor broken
leg, which, while it would mend, would never let Dryas
walk perfectly straight again.</p>

<p>Dryas bore his pain with a look which ever and again
started her tears, the look of a child come home.</p>

<p>As soon as Melantho came to replace her Theria
turned to attend Eëtíon’s wounds. She knelt before
him, binding up his bleeding ankle, then carefully
washed the deep gash in his shoulder where the sword
had grazed over the top of his shield. Her heart sang
with the task.</p>

<p>Nikander, perhaps because he was an older, more skilful
warrior, had received only scratches. Indeed the fight
had not been long. The Persians had been conquered
by the god ere ever man struck one blow.</p>

<p>More and more Delphians crowded into the Precinct.
The happy news seemed to have mounted on wings of
its own to those who had been hidden on Parnassos.</p>

<p>They came down in groups or singly, and each as he
entered had to hear the story again from those fortunate
ones who had stayed. All the talk was of the wonders,
the portents, the direct action of the god. They told
each other the tales which were to become the rich
traditions of their race. Their faith grew with the
telling.</p>

<p>And who shall say that their faith was vain? Even
we to-day receive the benefit of that strange repulse,
which helped to keep Europe what it was, to make it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_249"></a>[249]</span>
what it is to-day. We may not explain it as they did,
but the mysterious, deciding succour is a basic historical
fact. Apollo had saved more than his visible
treasures by this prompt defence.</p>

<p>Now other Delphians came in with armfuls of battle-litter
they had found on the road, the curious wicker
shields, despicable in Greek eyes, rich torn garments,
gold chains, head pins set with rubies, the silly Persian
caps which set them all a-laughing, and whole mule-packs
of trousers which made them laugh still more.</p>

<p>“Men, full-grown men, to hamper their legs with
such a foolish gear!”</p>

<p>They found also the curious horse heads which the
black men had worn. They were but skins flayed, with
ears and mane remaining.</p>

<p>“And we thought those were monsters and were
afraid!” laughed one.</p>

<p>“But all the gold must be saved for the god, no gift
of ours, but his own, his right,” said another.</p>

<p>Instantly all assented to this. Their hearts were
dewy fresh with gratitude. They were like noisy, happy
children.</p>

<p>Melantho was bending over Dryas. He had reacted
now from the first shock and was restless with fever.</p>

<p>“Oh, let us go home,” pleaded Melantho. “See, this
is no place for my sick boy. Oh, I want to go home.”</p>

<p>Poor home-body, she was almost in terror at being
from under her accustomed roof.</p>

<p>Nikander held Dryas’s hand. His face clouded as
he answered her.</p>

<p>“If we go, we shall have to do without Theria’s
help,” he answered.</p>

<p>“I can care for my son,” said Melantho. “But
Theria—surely to-day the priests will let her——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span></p>

<p>Nikander was looking away. “I do not dare to provoke
them,” he said very low.</p>

<p>Dryas stirred with a moan of pain.</p>

<p>“Yes, wife,” said Nikander decisively. “I know
that we should go.”</p>

<p>He went over to where Theria and Eëtíon together
were binding up the leg of a stout young guardsman,
he howling with true Greek ardour.</p>

<p>Nikander touched Theria’s arm.</p>

<p>“Daughter,” he said, “Dryas is growing worse and
I fear we must take him home.”</p>

<p>“Yes; and, Father, we must see that the litter-slaves
walk slowly and very steadily. I will try——”</p>

<p>Tears filled Nikander’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Dear heart, I wish I could take you with us. I
do not dare to take you,” he said.</p>

<p>Theria whitened as sorrow stole over and fixed itself
upon her face.</p>

<p>She moved close to him.</p>

<p>“I had forgotten,” she whispered. “Oh, Father, I
want to go home—home!”</p>

<p>Nikander answered nothing. He could not answer.
He led her over to a corner.</p>

<p>“Oh,” she moaned, “that I should have begged to be
priestess. How foolish, witless——”</p>

<p>“I was the fool to allow you. But remember,
Daughter, always remember the deed which priesthood
let you do. Your Prayer to the Winds was answered,
abundantly answered. You helped to save the
fleet, my darling. And you did it thinking you must die
for doing it.”</p>

<p>His praise took her by surprise, but it only made it
more impossible to part from him.</p>

<p>She stole into his arms like a frightened child. He<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
dared not tell her the hope he had for her. It was too
faint a hope for that. He knew well that his best
comforting was to remind her of what her priesthood
had accomplished.</p>

<p>“Your Salamis oracle. We have yet to hear from
that. The battle must even now be raging at Athens.
They tell me that never would Themistokles have kept
the Athenians to their task but for that oracle to
hearten them. You gave the oracle as being your own,
but you know now it was the god’s.”</p>

<p>She was trembling with the sobs she must keep still.</p>

<p>“And, Daughter, never go to the tripod again,” he
urged. “Promise me that.”</p>

<p>“Never, never the tripod,” she answered.</p>

<p>“No matter how they push you, no matter what
rites.”</p>

<p>“No—no.”</p>

<p>Here Eëtíon came over to them, asking, “What is it?”
and before they answered knowing what it was.</p>

<p>“But no, no, no, Nikander. Not the Pythia House
again,” he pleaded.</p>

<p>Nikander had to take charge with decision.</p>

<p>“It must be, Eëtíon. It must be. Go, Eëtíon, and
take Dryas home. I will care for Theria.”</p>

<p>There was no chance for good-bye in what the lovers
felt to be the last parting.</p>

<p>As for Nikander, mounting the Sacred Way with his
arm about his child, the joy of victory, the safety of
Delphi, were lost in bitter heartaches and self-reproach.</p>

<span class="smaller">NIKANDER PLEADS FOR HIS DAUGHTER</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Early</span> next morning Nikander returned to the
Precinct. The smoke of the Great Altar was
lifting in a glorious column. Not one priest of
Delphi but had promised gifts to the Far-Darter if
he would but save them. And now they were offering
those gifts.</p>

<p>Nikander mingled with the crowd on the temple
platform. He was heavy hearted where all were gay.
Old Akeretos was sitting on the temple steps worn out
with hours of ritual. A little squat Delphic farmer was
talking to him. Near by stood two cloaked females.</p>

<p>“And, Akeretos,” said the eager little man, as if driving
a bargain, “you can’t get any better anywhere.
The two of ’em at once and portents to both of ’em.”</p>

<p>“Bring them here,” said the old shrine president.</p>

<p>The man pushed the two females to the front and
without ceremony flicked off their veils.</p>

<p>He showed two girls as alike as two peas. They were
peasant-built but flabby. Their faces, brown because
the sun had made them so, had somehow a look
of paleness under the brown. The eyes of both were
large and haunted as if with ill-health. They were
simpering with the excitement.</p>

<p>“Hyeroche, here, is the oldest,” went on the farmer.
“Before she was born my wife had a dream. Any of
the neighbours can tell ye, for, Paian help us, she told it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
enough! She dreamed that she was searchin’ for her
baby in the mountains, an’ she found it, a little weepin’
thing lyin’ on top of a milkin’ stool. She started to
take it off of the milkin’ stool, but quick, the milkin’
stool shot up tall with its three legs, a very tripod, an’
she couldn’t reach the baby.</p>

<p>“Now I ain’t no reader of dreams. But what do ye
think o’ that, Akeretos? Doesn’t it seem pointin’ the
baby to be Pythia?”</p>

<p>Old Akeretos nodded. He was much impressed.</p>

<p>“An’ this other one here, Timo, before she was born,
Paian help us, the same dream to her, too.”</p>

<p>Akeretos was not listening. He was studying the
girls. Well did he know the successful Pythia type.</p>

<p>The little farmer turned to Nikander. “Now ain’t
they just made for Pythias?” he demanded, “the both
on ’em, an’ free-born Delphians both.”</p>

<p>Nikander studied them. He was trying to keep his
judgment clear and unbiassed by his earnest wish.
If these girls were made Pythias at once would it not
afford a chance to secure his daughter’s freedom?</p>

<p>Akeretos turned to Nikander.</p>

<p>“These might put your daughter into the background,”
he said. “You will forgive me, Nikander, if
I say that these have more the Pythia look than has
Theria.”</p>

<p>“My daughter is not the Pythian type,” said Nikander,
trying to speak indifferently. “I realize that,
Akeretos. Anyway, we require three Pythias. It has
been the custom and is right.”</p>

<p>That afternoon a council of all the priests was held
to decide upon the farmer girls.</p>

<p>Beforehand Nikander sought his kinsman Timon.
Perhaps Timon would listen now as he would not on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span>
that other occasion when Nikander had spoken—then
when the Persians were so nigh at hand. Nikander
must steer his course carefully. Timon must not
suspect the dangerous truth—Theria’s deception on the
tripod. Yet Nikander must bring forth every argument
possible for his child’s release.</p>

<p>“Timon,” he began, “I am feeling more and more
that my daughter Theria is not the Pythia type.”</p>

<p>“Not the type!” repeated his kinsman. “But she
gave magnificent oracles, Nikander. Very unusual
oracles. And the manner of giving was unusual, also.
Do not you think so?”</p>

<p>Timon looked sharply at Nikander, or did Nikander
fancy it? Nikander had much ado to keep himself
steady and unmoved. He hastily changed the subject.</p>

<p>“Yes, they were good oracles. But the girl is breaking
too fast under the ecstasy. That, of course, would
make me wish to have her cease prophesying. But that
is not all. I would not let mere personal feelings sway
me. You know that, Timon.”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Theria had a vision on the mountain. You have
no doubt of that, have you?”</p>

<p>Timon assented. To the Greek this was easy of
belief. Timon had seen Theria in her state of trance.
He had seen her yesterday, and even then the expression
of her face showed the vision state through which she
had passed. Yes, yes, Theria had seen a vision.</p>

<p>“She has lately told me more about it,” pursued
Nikander. “Apollo spoke to her. She has told me
the words of the god and I have written them down.”</p>

<p>With a hand he could not keep from trembling
Nikander brought forth the tablet.</p>

<p>Timon read it slowly, as Greeks were wont to read.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
Again he read it. “No priestess of mine art thou.—Begone
from my temple.—Nay, for I love thee—thou
hast sung at my bidding.”</p>

<p>“Was all this in it when you spoke of this before?”
asked Timon seriously.</p>

<p>“Yes, the same.”</p>

<p>“I remember only the silver shaft of Apollo. But this!—Why,
Nikander, the god has actually driven the girl
from his temple. It might even be dangerous to hold
her there after this express command.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that?” queried Nikander eagerly.
“Will you say that in the Council?”</p>

<p>“But suppose she is freed—what should then be done
with her?” asked Timon.</p>

<p>But with this encouragement Nikander determined
to apply formally to the Priests’ Council for her release.</p>

<p>Never in all his days would Nikander forget the
bitter anxiety of that afternoon with the Council.
Many strifes had he striven with that august body,
strifes for the good name of Delphi, strifes for the
honour and safety of Hellas, yet never one that had
given him this suffocation at the thought of defeat.</p>

<p>Timon became his earnest helper and Nikander
sorely needed help.</p>

<p>“Never before,” maintained the older priests,
“never before had the Pythia been given back to her
family or been given in marriage. It would cause a
pestilence.”</p>

<p>But as the debate progressed Nikander gradually
became aware of his own new power in the Council. For
many months Nikander had been the sole one who had
counselled resistance to the Persian. It was Nikander
who had supplicated for the more hopeful oracles and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
received them. Suppose the more timid interpretations
had prevailed, where would the Delphians now be?</p>

<p>Nikander had been right and his prayers had changed
the mind of the god. Now Nikander was making a
strange request. Might he not be right in this also?
Surely Nikander would not ask this save in honest
conviction. Had Nikander ever been selfish toward
the shrine? Would he ask that his daughter be dismissed
if it were likely to bring disaster? Did he not
bring them now the god’s actual command: “Begone
from my temple”?</p>

<p>Nikander saw friend after friend spring to his feet
with arguments like these until his heart warmed and
in a clear, impassioned speech he moved the Council to
his side.</p>

<p>It was old Akeretos who made answer.</p>

<p>“Apollo has spoken to free the girl. It is not usual.
But neither is it usual for Apollo to appear in person
and hurl mountains upon the enemy. It is a time of
portents and wonders. Let the girl be freed, and at
once.”</p>

<p>Nikander’s brain whirled as this verdict was pronounced.</p>

<p>But a still further joy awaited him.</p>

<p>Kobon, who had always been his bitterest antagonist,
now rose in the Council and proposed to elect Dryas,
son of Nikander, to the priesthood, also to give Dryas
the crown for the best warrior in yesterday’s battle.</p>

<span class="smaller">AGAIN HOME</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">On leaving</span> the Council, Nikander did what
no other father in Hellas would have done:
He went first to release his daughter before
bringing the good news to his son.</p>

<p>He could not bear that Theria should learn her freedom
from any but himself. Old Akeretos went with
him to confirm his authority in the Pythia House. To
tell the truth, they ascended the Precinct with no little
trepidation.</p>

<p>If you had asked who ruled the priests in Delphi not
one would have answered: “The old peasant woman
Tuchè.” Yet such was the case. Tuchè had a tongue
of fire. Akeretos knocked faintly, and the authoritative
one herself appeared.</p>

<p>But she told the news quite otherwise than they had
expected.</p>

<p>“Theria? No Pythoness, ye say? An’ did it take all
ye men in day-long council to find that out? <em>I</em> knew it
from the first. She’s no Pythia, no, not if she gave the
best oracles ever. Take her away, do—before she puts
notions into the heads of the two new ones, good as
gold.”</p>

<p>Nikander did not wait for the finish. He ran past
Tuchè to Theria’s room.</p>

<p>Theria sat there on her couch staring at nothing in
the same melancholy apathy which before had so<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span>
troubled the temple women. She did not rouse until
her father stood quite before her. Then up went her
longing hands.</p>

<p>“Father, Father,” she whispered amazedly.</p>

<p>But Nikander in his delight threw both arms about
her.</p>

<p>“You are free, my own darling Theria, you are free,”
he said. “The Council has freed you.”</p>

<p>But he should have been more careful with his news.</p>

<p>“No,” she said wildly. “Oh, I have to stay here.
Here all my life—all my life.”</p>

<p>“Not one further minute,” he asserted. “Dear
child, I have come to take you home.”</p>

<p>At this dear telling she burst into uncontrollable
weeping. “Tuchè will not let me,” she kept saying
like a frightened child. “No, she will not let me.”</p>

<p>“By the gods she will. Theria, quiet yourself. There,
dear little one, Father will care for you now.”</p>

<p>He was like a tender nurse comforting her. He
called the temple slave.</p>

<p>“Get this Pythia robe off my daughter at once,” he
commanded. “Where is the white robe in which she
came?”</p>

<p>He himself helped to fasten the shoulder pins, unheard-of
service for a father. Often he kissed her when
her tears ran down afresh. By his excitement he made
it the harder for her to grow calm. Then he threw the
himation over her head and face and hurried her out.</p>

<p>They reached home after a happy walk hand in hand.
The open air was always tonic to Theria. She was her
bright self again when they had reached the threshold.
Melantho and Eëtíon were tending Dryas in the aula.</p>

<p>With a cry Eëtíon leaped up, knowing the beloved
figure before her face was revealed. Melantho ran to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
her. Dryas reached out arms from his couch, calling,
“Sister, Sister,” and the slaves came hurrying from
everywhere.</p>

<p>Nikander had to explain a hundred questions how she
came to be really free.</p>

<p>Dryas kept her hand affectionately.</p>

<p>“Now home will be home,” he said. “It has never
been the same since you went away.”</p>

<p>“Dear Theria,” laughed Nikander, “even the fish
have tasted wrong. I did not know you directed the
cooking of the fish.”</p>

<p>Then he turned to Dryas.</p>

<p>“Dryas,” he questioned, “have they told you the
news?”</p>

<p>“What news?”</p>

<p>Then all the joyfulness was to be gone through again
as Nikander told of Dryas’s election to the priesthood
and his crowning.</p>

<p>Nikander, being by nature courageous, was never
quite to realize the struggle Dryas had had to win such
a crown. But fine deeds he did know, and felt new
kinship with his son and all the old love and pride. As
the two were talking together, Eëtíon softly drew
Theria aside.</p>

<p>How strong and heavenly the joy in his face as he
kissed her. Theria had never known how godlike
Eëtíon was until now, his eyes so shining upon her and so
full of awe. What was this strange love which had
come to her from the gods, a thing so unheard-of for a
mere Greek girl? Their very silence together seemed
holy, difficult to break.</p>

<p>“Oh, do you think that Father will allow——” she began;
and then, realizing what she was about to ask, she
blushed and hushed her speech.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span></p>

<p>“Allow us what, dear Theria?”</p>

<p>He lifted her hands in both of his, hardly listening to
her words. And before he could answer Melantho
broke in upon them.</p>

<p>“Great Heavens! Theria, what are you doing?
What am <em>I</em> doing to let you stay here? Come back to
our aula at once.”</p>

<p>Theria was too happy to be disobedient. She took
her mother’s hand and went back with her to the
women’s apartment where the door was quickly shut.</p>

<span class="smaller">A SCULPTOR’S RESPECTABILITY</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Now</span> that abnormal conditions were past, Nikander
and his family returned to conventional
ways. Theria must not meet nor see Eëtíon.
Of course she must not. She must be shut in the
women’s court whenever he came to the house.</p>

<p>Nikander gave his formal consent to the marriage.
He loved Eëtíon with all his heart. The good youth
now would have been his choice for Theria even if
Theria had had no wish in the matter. Yet as the
days went by Nikander dreaded the marriage. Marriage
with a metic was indeed a serious step.</p>

<p>Nikander knew his daughter well. He knew that
while she now made the sacrifice gladly that later when
she saw her sons excluded from the priesthood, herself
excluded from processional rites and perhaps taunted
by women of her own class, Theria’s proud spirit would
revolt. He even wondered if her love would outlast
the strain. Love so burning bright in youth may be
strangely quenched by hard conditions.</p>

<p>Nikander’s attitude unconsciously affected Eëtíon.
He, too, now that he faced his marriage, realized how sad
a sacrifice he was asking of her who had set him free.</p>

<p>He had hoped that Theria would speak to him from
her window so that he could ask her of these things
face to face. But this Theria was too loyal to do.</p>

<p>She sent her messages by her father.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span></p>

<p>“So soon will come our life-long happiness,” she said,
“we must bear this parting now.”</p>

<p>At last Eëtíon was in serious misery for the trials
looming ahead. He sent question to Theria by
Nikander.</p>

<p>“Had she thought of all the future? Did she want
to decide again?”</p>

<p>Nikander came back laughing.</p>

<p>“Never send me on such an errand again, young
man,” he told him. “She was almost as abusive as old
Tuchè herself. She said she had not supposed that you
would so insult her. That if she were as great a fool as
you seem to be she would retaliate by distrusting your
love. But that she does not do. She trusts your love,
and you by this time should trust hers.”</p>

<p>Eëtíon laughed joyously. “Apollo bless her! she is
as lovely in her anger as in everything else!”</p>

<p>Upon which Nikander named him an Eros-infatuated
youth.</p>

<p>But the incident cleared the air. From that time
Nikander trusted his daughter’s decision. So, Melantho
having made ready the linens, garments, and
embroideries she considered essential, Theria and Eëtíon
were betrothed before witnesses, solemnly in the aula.
For a few happy moments they stood together and
touched hands, though Theria had to be veiled. The
ceremony was more binding than the wedding which
was to follow later. Theria returned to her room
knowing that now she belonged to Eëtíon as his goods
and chattels belonged, but her heart was singing for joy.</p>

<p>It was at the betrothal feast, when it was too late for
mending, that Eëtíon revealed his one defect.</p>

<p>They were chatting after the meal, or rather sitting
silent while Eëtíon talked. For none of the youths<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
of Delphi had had such adventures as Eëtíon, by storm
of ocean, by cruelty of pirates, deceit of merchants in
the ports. As a captive he had seen practically all
the far ports of the West.</p>

<p>Eëtíon sat upright on his couch, too animated to
recline, his dark eyes now brightening with some memory,
now filling with terror or triumph. Near him was
one of the many small tables of a Greek room.</p>

<p>Upon this table had been left, no doubt by Kairos
himself, the god of chance, a double handful of smooth
clay. It had been brought that morning by some citizens
from far away who wanted to establish a sale for
it in Delphi. Nikander had pronounced it the finest in
texture he had ever seen. Then it had been left here.</p>

<p>Eëtíon idly picked it up as he talked, working it with
his deft fingers.</p>

<p>Gradually it became soft, malleable. Absently he
shaped it into a thick pillar, then, as if in sudden decision,
began to mould it. He ceased talking, forgot his
guests entirely, quite unconscious that they were watching
what he did.</p>

<p>Under his swift fingers the clay soon took the form
of a youth. “Look, it is beautiful,” whispered Dryas,
wondering.</p>

<p>Now Eëtíon looked up impatiently, seized upon a
plectrum as a tool, and began to work again in mad
haste.</p>

<p>More and more lovely the little youth became, not
standing on both feet in the old hieratic attitude, but
leaning forward with one leg advanced as if running,
head thrown back and both arms outstretched toward
an invisible goal. Time passed by, but Eëtíon was
unaware of it. Now began the muscle modelling, dry,
and at points stylized, yet lovely and alive, the delicate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
thighs full of strength, the spare abdomen showing the
play of running muscles, the chest lifted and full of
breath.</p>

<p>“It is Ladas,” they cried, “Ladas, the Argive runner.”</p>

<p>Now Eëtíon began to etch the hair in fine-drawn lines
in the old fashion and bind it down with a fillet. Nikander
saw at once that this figure was the result of long
and intense imagining of the mind. Eëtíon could not
otherwise have modelled with such swiftness. The
skill, too, was no idle skill, it was the result of long hours
of training and toil.</p>

<p>At length it satisfied its creator. Eëtíon breathed
deep, looked up and saw all the company gazing at him,
and laughed a quick, embarrassed laugh.</p>

<p>“Eëtíon!” spoke Nikander, amazed. “Surely you
are not a sculptor!”</p>

<p>Eëtíon hung his head. “I sometimes think I am,”
he confessed.</p>

<p>“But your father Euclides was a high-born citizen.
He surely would not give you over to the sculptor’s
trade.”</p>

<p>“No,” answered Eëtíon. Then on the defensive,
“But after all, Nikander, is there any nobler way of
honouring the gods than by beautiful sculpture? What
would Delphi be without its statues and its songs?”</p>

<p>“Oh, but Eëtíon, this is <em>hand</em> craft. See, your hands
are soiled even now. Song is the work of the mind
alone.”</p>

<p>“But you use the hand to play the lyre,” said Eëtíon,
quickly hiding his dirty hands in his himation.</p>

<p>“Apollo presides over song,” retorted Nikander.
“No such god fosters sculptor work.”</p>

<p>“There is Hephæstos.”</p>

<p>“The ugly lame god. By heaven, Eëtíon, you are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
no Hephæstos.” Everybody laughed. “The beautiful
Eëtíon himself with the limping, grizzled
one!”</p>

<p>“I am serious,” insisted Nikander; “you must explain
this thing. Who taught you?”</p>

<p>“Ageladas,” answered Eëtíon, “but of course my
father never knew.”</p>

<p>“Ah, no wonder you model well,” said Nikander, for
Ageladas, the Argive, was the greatest teacher of sculpture
in Greece.</p>

<p>“My pedagogos was Ageladas’s friend,” went on
Eëtíon, “and he used to stop with me at Ageladas’s workshop
on our way from school. I—well, I played with
the clay as I do now and Ageladas saw and praised me.
But oh, it was not the praise, it was the love of making
beautiful gods and men which possessed me. All
through my school hours I forgot my Homer, longing
to be at work with Ageladas. I bribed my pedagogos
again and again to bring me there. Myron was in the
workshop, too, and I learned at his side. Then one day
Ageladas told me he would exhibit one of my statues
as his own.” Eëtíon laughed softly and tears came
into his eyes.</p>

<p>“Ah, never shall I forget my father stopping by my
own statue. ‘This is most beautiful of all,’ he said.
‘This youth pouring the libation. See how he worships,
how shyly he supplicates before his god?’ Then such
happiness welled up within me that I could not speak.
Dear Father, he never guessed that the statue was mine.”</p>

<p>Nikander took Eëtíon’s hand.</p>

<p>“But now, Eëtíon, now that you are a Delphian, a
son of my house, surely you will not do this curious
thing, which no well-born citizen would do? Delphi
will give you large activities.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span></p>

<p>“No, dear Nikander,” answered Eëtíon gently. “No.”</p>

<p>He took the little runner and with a single fierce
pressure sent him back into the clay whence he had
come.</p>

<p>“Oh, don’t, don’t do that,” cried they all at once, for
they loved its loveliness.</p>

<p>“It would perish anyway,” said Eëtíon sadly. “The
clay would soon crack.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE UNWILLING COLONIST</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">On the</span> far-away coast of Sicily, the western outpost
of the world, lay the little town of Inessa.
One day men came from the neighbouring town
Catana, attacked Inessa, and razed it to the ground.
This was done while Theria was yet spinning at home,
before she was immured in the Pythia House. And
this one cruel act, performed by men she had never
known, in a town whose name she had never heard, was
to affect Theria’s life more profoundly than any act of
father, mother, or brother.</p>

<p>It was her fate.</p>

<p>A purposeful intent thus seemed to run through
circumstance, deflecting it toward a far-off goal.</p>

<p>Most of Inessa’s inhabitants were killed outright, but
among those who were cast upon the world was an awkward
youth—one Hyllos, son of Inessa’s most prominent
citizen—but an ill-born young man who stammered
abominably. This Hyllos being come to the shore of
Phokis thought it a good opportunity to visit the
Delphic Oracle and inquire for the curing of his speech.</p>

<p>But when Hyllos stood before the tripod the priestess
answered not at all concerning his speech, but bade him:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“Return to Sicily and rebuild Inessa.”</p>
</div>

<p>He was so disappointed that he left the tripod almost
before the Pythoness had finished speaking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>But from that hour misfortune followed Hyllos.</p>

<p>At last he became so frightened that he bestirred
himself belatedly to obey the Oracle. He secured a
ship and a few people willing to go to Sicily, but still he
dreaded the colonizing task. And on the very day of
Theria’s betrothal Hyllos reappeared in Delphi, praying
to be released from Apollo’s command.</p>

<p>On this occasion the Oracle reproved him roundly.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The ruins of Inessa disturb the peace of the Delphic god. Yes,
and yet more misfortune shall overtake thee unless thou rebuild
Inessa on a height where trees invite the birds. Of high choice
is the one who goeth with thee.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hyllos next morning met Nikander in the Precinct
and to him poured out his troubles.</p>

<p>“I cannot rebuild Inessa, O priest,” he said. “Only
a few poor shepherds are left there. Our Catanian
neighbours in their raid upon us killed all our leading
citizens. They carried away our wealth and destroyed
everything. Inessa is ruined beyond repair. Oh,
no doubt the god means to destroy me also, and takes
this way of making me worthy of death.”</p>

<p>Nikander quieted the young man as was his wont,
then bade him wait in Delphi until the priests should
think and advise with each other over the problem.</p>

<p>The young man’s predicament interested Nikander.
Like all Delphic priests he loved those far-away colonies
of the west: Tarentum, Catana, Syracuse, Croton,
Elia—scattered at right intervals along the coast of
Greater Greece. They were young in power, wonderful
places of sunny beach and wooded hill, while in
their backlands were stretches of the richest soil in the
world.</p>

<p>Almost all those cities had been either founded by
the Oracle of Delphi or greatly helped by it. To some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
Delphi had given laws, to others had sent great leaders
in times of need. In the case of Cyrene in Africa, the
Oracle had, in some secret way, selected the site and
insisted by repeated commands until the “fortunate
city” had been built. Delphi retained no lordship over
these colonies—her children. She was satisfied to feed
their spirit and to receive in return their worship, their
tithes, and free gifts.</p>

<p>Nikander left the young man and at once went into
the cella of the Great Temple. Here in the closed
back room he brought forth long-treasured maps of the
priests, ancient ones of pottery, later ones of sheepskin
and papyrus.</p>

<p>He studied them absorbedly. Yes, at the site of the
destroyed Inessa was a great stretch of unhabitation
on the coast. A city was needed there and the port at
the mouth of the river Symæthus was good. How well
the god had planned!</p>

<p>Nikander then went to old Akeretos who without delay
summoned the Council of the priests.</p>

<p>They met not in the Council House, for the day was
warm, but up in the great lesche or colonnade of the
Precinct. Greeks never willingly did their thinking
away from the open air. Sitting thus on the stone
seats, they could look down through the opening of the
steep vale to the far-off bit of sapphire loveliness which
was the Corinthian Gulf.</p>

<p>Nikander showed them his map.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Karamanor’s father whose name was
Glaucos. “I remember Inessa. Saw it during my
travel year. I recall the back country, too. Lovely
shaded heights having wide prospect. I could quite
see them in memory as I stood there yesterday by the
tripod. And even while I was thinking, the Pythia<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
spoke of them, ‘A height where trees invite the birds.’
The oracle was marvellously clear.”</p>

<p>Glaucos looked awestruck, for the god’s message was
not always so revealing. The tranced Pythia did
not invariably reflect the priestly mind.</p>

<p>“Inessa must be rebuilt,” declared Timon. “Apollo
has spoken it, and Apollo is lord of migrations.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” agreed Nikander. “But this poor stammering
Hyllos cannot rebuild it. Strange it is that upon
such an inefficient person the god should have laid the
charge. Within a century past we have not founded
so important a city.”</p>

<p>“The god sees that Hyllos cannot do it,” declared
a third priest, Melas. “Did you note the oracle
yesterday? ‘Of high choice the one who goeth with
thee.’ What can that mean but that we are to choose
out some real leader, some adequate, big-minded man,
to found the city? He must go with Hyllos. Thus
shall the oracle be fulfilled.”</p>

<p>“One of high choice refers to Apollo himself,” declared
Glaucos. “That was said to encourage Hyllos
on the enterprise.”</p>

<p>“That’s the way I understood it,” assented a young
priest.</p>

<p>Akeretos brought forth the oracle tablet, and earnestly
the priests reread it.</p>

<p>“It means another man to go with Hyllos. Melas
is right,” said Nikander. “Why should the priestess
refer to Apollo? Of course the god always goes.”</p>

<p>“A leader is of utmost importance,” urged Melas.
“The god sees that and gives us the command to find
a good one. It’s plain as sunlight.”</p>

<p>“The oracle would be futile otherwise,” put in Timon
decisively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span></p>

<p>Agreement was soon reached as to the oracle’s meaning
and the urgent need of a leader. Then came the
all-important choice of a man.</p>

<p>“Shall he be a Delphian?” was the first question.</p>

<p>“Yes, I think so,” said old Akeretos. “Colonies
are not often founded these days. It may be years
before another goes out. ’Tis a rare chance to
strengthen Apollo’s influence in the west.”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” chorused the priests. “A Delphian, by
all means.”</p>

<p>Nikander’s face suddenly shone. He had wished for
many a month to do some service for Karamanor and
Agis in return for their honourable treatment of his
poor son Lycophron. They were younger sons without
means. Here was a chance to make them both
rich and prominent.</p>

<p>“I propose Karamanor and Agis, Glaucos’s sons, as
leaders of the colony,” said Nikander.</p>

<p>The priests discussed the two young men at length,
but in the end rejected both—honest young fellows but
not of calibre for this business. Then Dryas was proposed
but quickly rejected. Then several other young
men of Delphi. It was not easy to find a leader of the
peculiar genius needed, fearless yet not quarrelsome,
young yet understanding, having the statesman’s uncanny
vision to discern the hidden meaning of events
and their unlooked-for but inevitable resultants.</p>

<p>During this later discussion Timon had remained
quite silent. Evidently he was thinking something
through before proposal. Timon’s was the most original
mind in the Council, and Nikander awaited his
word with pleasure. However, amazement rather than
pleasure followed it.</p>

<p>“O priests,” at last said Timon, “has it occurred to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
you that there have been women who were successful
<i>oekists</i> of colonies?”</p>

<p>“Women! what nonsense, Timon. What are you
joking about?”</p>

<p>The Council broke into puzzled laughter. For women
were a perennial source of satire.</p>

<p>“No, no, I mean it. Did not Dido, the Tyrian,
found Carthage and was faithful to the city even unto
death?”</p>

<p>“Ay, but Dido was no Greek.”</p>

<p>“No, but Manto was—Manto who founded Clarus.
She was a <em>priest’s daughter</em>, a priest of Apollo.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Nikander guessed Timon’s meaning.</p>

<p>It was Theria—none other, whom Timon was about
to propose for this high, amazing trust.</p>

<p>But why? How could Timon know that the girl
had the needed power—Nikander’s little girl, hidden
away in her home, unknown?</p>

<p>For a moment Nikander pictured her thus and
trembled to think how his familiar Theria could wield
the power of state.</p>

<p>Then with an overwhelming pride he realized that she
could! <em>She could do it!</em> What else was the meaning
of her trenchant questionings, her revealing suggestions
in matters which puzzled himself, her overpowering
interest in public affairs in spite of all rebukes, her
oracles, by which in the very face of death she had sent
courage to the armies?</p>

<p>Yes, yes, Theria could! And the high task would
meet and satisfy her mental need.</p>

<p>Ah, but that task would take her away over seas;
away, away to the west. Nikander would never see
his child again. The very life would be torn out of
him to part with her. It was too sudden, too unexpected.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
He must call aloud to Timon to stop—stop!
But no. Did he dare stand in Theria’s way,
to deprive her of this gift? Was it not her right, her
fate from the gods? Nikander hid his face from the
Council. They would never understand this emotion
of his—this dependence upon a girl-child.</p>

<p>But what were the priests saying? With quick concern
Nikander looked up again.</p>

<p>“It’s not only foolish, Timon; it’s dangerous!”
Melas spoke. “Give a woman power like that, she’ll go
mad with it.”</p>

<p>Melas was one of those Greeks, a numerous class,
who hated women with a curious active hatred which
seemed almost bred of fear. They laughed at it all,
of course. Why could not babies be found in temples
and thus women utterly done away? Wives! what
silly, miserable creatures. Hetairai! what undoing of
mankind. And behind all the gibing was the curious
hating fear. Nikander knew that Melas would not
stop short of harming Theria to keep her from being
nominated. Keenly Nikander heard the argument.</p>

<p>“I’ve followed you, Timon, in most of your proposals,”
said another priest, “but now, by the gods,
this is too much! But say, old fellow, you <em>are</em> joking,
you know you are.”</p>

<p>“It seems to me you insult all the able young men of
Delphi,” said Glaucos.</p>

<p>“What young man have we in Delphi who has seen
Apollo face to face?” retorted Timon. “Theria,
daughter of Nikander, has been found worthy to behold
the god.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, that’s so,” assented some.</p>

<p>“Go fetch her oracle tablets, let’s see what Apollo
said to her,” said one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span></p>

<p>A messenger was dispatched to the temple.</p>

<p>“And not only has she beheld Apollo,” went on
Timon. “But she has spoken for him. Think of those
two oracles of hers on the tripod. If it had not been
for those oracles, where would Delphi be now? On
the Persian side! In disgrace! As it is, men are
throwing the earlier oracles of Aristonikè in our face.
‘Persian lovers!’ they call us. ‘Medizers, you Delphians.’
And for my part I have naught to answer
but Theria’s oracles. That silences ’em. Salamis
and the storm of Artemisium! She foretold them
both.”</p>

<p>“Ay, foretold them,” screamed Melas. “But what
had she to do with it? It was the god that spoke
through her. She was nothing but his mouthpiece.”</p>

<p>“She was more, more I tell you, Melas. She understood
those oracles—saw exactly whither they led.
She gave them, rejoicing in what they were to accomplish.
She——”</p>

<p>“One would think,” interrupted Melas, “from what
you say, Timon, that she made them up, and that you
knew it!”</p>

<p>“By Zeus, it seemed that way to me. Even at the
time I thought so,” said the young priest, his echo.</p>

<p>Ah, they had scented it out! What Nikander had
feared—Theria’s strange deception (or was it deception?
Nikander himself hardly thought so now).
If this question should come up in the Council, what
punishment might not fall upon Theria? Who could
foresee the end?</p>

<p>Not one trace of this terror, however, showed in
Nikander’s face. Your true Greek was on his mettle
at such time. He spoke with trumpet anger.</p>

<p>“I will not have my daughter insulted in the Council!<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
If you cannot discuss her honourably, do not
discuss her at all. You all know that her oracle trance
on the tripod was so real that it nearly killed her.
You all know that Apollo spoke afterward to her in
the mountain. And you, and you, and you”—turning
to the priests—“saw her after her vision. Was
ever any vision condition more patent?”</p>

<p>“No, no!” they said. “That vision was true if ever
vision was.”</p>

<p>“Then stop this cavilling about my daughter.
Either she has the power to conduct the colony or else
she has not. That alone is up for your decision.”</p>

<p>Since Salamis, Nikander had been a most powerful
figure in the Council, ardently loved, sincerely feared.
The lovers spoke first.</p>

<p>“You know your daughter, Nikander. Tell us what
you think of her.”</p>

<p>“I think she can do it. Whether I am willing for her
to go is another matter. Oh,” Nikander added, “I
was as unwilling as you are to acknowledge this power
in my daughter. Like you I thought it insulted my
sons who should have it in her stead. But hers is the
gift of mind. I have been taught that, obstinately
fighting. I have been punished until I saw.”</p>

<p>“Punished by herself?” sneered Melas.</p>

<p>“No, by some unrelenting god,” he answered with
the love of Theria shining in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Remember,” spoke Timon again. “She has seen
Apollo. We want Delphi kept alive in the hearts of
her colonists. Could we do better than send one who
has beheld the god?”</p>

<p>This argument won.</p>

<p>It was as if Apollo himself were bestowing the leadership
upon his ardent young priestess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span></p>

<p>Nikander and Timon left the Council together.
Each gazed for a moment into the other’s face.</p>

<p>“Well?” said Timon, smiling.</p>

<p>“Well!” said Nikander, still half amazed. “You
have let me in for a fine adventure.”</p>

<p>“Aren’t you glad?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I am glad,” responded Nikander, but Timon
saw his eyes flush with tears.</p>

<p>“You are very fond of her?”</p>

<p>“Yes, oh, yes. She is closer to me than any other
now that I have grown to know her. But,” suddenly
lifting his head, “how in Zeus’s name did you
guess her, Timon? You never meet her as I do.”</p>

<p>“I did not have to guess. I saw.”</p>

<p>“Saw? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Her oracles on the tripod. She <em>did</em> make them,
Nikander. I know that. You know it! By Zeus, it
was a close shave in the Council.”</p>

<p>The sudden statement was like a thunder-clap.
Nikander shook with fear. He seized Timon’s arm.</p>

<p>“You will not accuse her! Timon! She was compelled.
She was——”</p>

<p>“No, no. Has not the god himself justified her?
Who am I to offer blame? But I saw her do it! And
by Zeus, it was the bravest deed, yes, and the most
intelligent that I ever saw in my life.”</p>

<p>“Oh,” breathed Nikander.</p>

<p>“At first I could not credit that she was doing it,
even though she was pronouncing the oracle as no one
had ever pronounced it—driving home its meaning,
by Hermes—driving it home! Then I saw the martyr
light in her face—the death light, expecting the god’s
lightning stroke. Did you note that agonized look
just before she fell?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span></p>

<p>“But she had done the deed. Done the thing that
you and I, Nikander, couldn’t bring about with all our
toil and effort.”</p>

<p>Nikander was too moved to speak.</p>

<p>“Ever since then,” went on Timon, “the girl’s
genius has haunted me. Horrible, you know! Such
genius to be wasted even though it be housed in a
woman. There!” he ended, laughing. “You have my
reasoning.”</p>

<p>Nikander’s gratitude beamed from his face. “The
gods bless you,” he said, “for giving the girl her
chance.”</p>

<span class="smaller">THE BIRD IN THE CAGE</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Nikander</span> came hurrying into the house.</p>

<p>“Where is Theria?” he demanded.</p>

<p>Time was when Nikander coming in had invariably
asked, “Where is Dryas?” Now it was always,
“Where is Theria?” looking about restlessly as
though home were not home until Theria appeared.</p>

<p>“Theria? She has gone to bed,” answered her
mother.</p>

<p>“To bed! But the sun has not yet set,” said Nikander.</p>

<p>“Yes, but that’s where she is all the same. She
said there was nothing more to do in the house so she
had better sleep. Of course there <em>is</em> more to do,”
complained Melantho. “You’d think she’d take more
interest in her bridal spinning. She says there are
already more linens and woollens than she can use in
twenty years if she had twenty children.”</p>

<p>“Well, aren’t there?” laughed Nikander.</p>

<p>“I should think she would like some more just to put
away. But she is so listless.”</p>

<p>Nikander smiled happily.</p>

<p>Listless! Ah, the dear child! She would be listless
no longer now that this supreme task had been thrust
into her hands. How strangely that had been done,
as if the god had done it beyond all human planning.
Ah, what a task! The eloquent statements of the afternoon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
had set the colony glowing in Nikander’s mind.
That Theria his child had been chosen leader still filled
him with an amazed joy. And Timon’s words! They
thrilled back upon Nikander like a triumphal song.
He was newly proud, newly tender toward his child
who, unaided, had faced death from the god. But
Timon had recognized the real power of the girl
which had quite escaped the father who loved her.
Nikander wondered at this so-common experience.
Theria was as good as a son to him now. Had this
happened to Lycophron or Dryas could he be any
happier than he was at this moment?</p>

<p>He turned impatiently to Melantho.</p>

<p>“Think you she is asleep?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Who, Theria? No, hardly yet. Have you something
for her to do?”</p>

<p>“By the gods, yes,” answered Nikander, and strode
off like a boy to Theria’s room.</p>

<p>Yes, she was asleep. How strange to see her bright
face so quieted. Gods! What a quantity of dark
hair she had spreading out over her pillow. What
a young child she was, after all.</p>

<p>“Theria,” he said, touching her shoulder.</p>

<p>Her eyes opened wide and alarmed.</p>

<p>“Father, what has happened?”</p>

<p>“Something wonderful, dear child, but you can never
guess it. Are you awake enough to understand?”</p>

<p>Theria sat up rubbing her eyes, dizzy from the depths
of sleep.</p>

<p>“About Eëtíon?” she murmured.</p>

<p>“No, not your lover. Yourself, yourself. Though,
by Hermes, Eëtíon comes into it, too.” Suddenly
Nikander found the matter difficult to explain. The
girl there on her bed looked so tender, so young! A<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
creature to cherish and protect. Hardly to send over
seas to contend with men and fate. He sat down beside
her and took her slender hand—that feminine hand
so curiously like his own.</p>

<p>“It is a brand-new colony,” he began, “a city that is
to be founded or rather refounded in Sicily.”</p>

<p>“Yes; what has that to do with me?” How infinitely
far she was from guessing the outcome!</p>

<p>Nikander went back to the beginning, told of Hyllos
and his difficult oracle, of the Council, of the proposal
of Karamanor and Agis, of Dryas. She grew keenly
interested.</p>

<p>“No, no, those could not be leaders, Father. I cannot
think of any one who could, any one big enough.
Let me see, let me see——”</p>

<p>She looked away, knitting her pretty brows.</p>

<p>“The priests are not in such doubt, Daughter,” said
Nikander tenderly. “They have chosen you!”</p>

<p>“Me!” She turned such an amazed face that
Nikander had to laugh.</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean? Why are you joking,
Father?”</p>

<p>The same question which Melas had asked.</p>

<p>“I am not joking, dear heart. The priests are in
earnest. They chose you because you have seen
Apollo. No one in our generation has done that, my
child.”</p>

<p>“The vision! How strange. How strange. And
the priests chose me, you say? The priests—me!”</p>

<p>Nikander went on explaining as if to dreaming ears.
She seemed not to hear him.</p>

<p>“Would Eëtíon go?” she queried.</p>

<p>“Yes, he would help you, but he would not be the
leader. That is for you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>“For me! Oh, Father,” she suddenly cried out.
“How could you suppose I could do it? Think of the
wisdom, the strength to command men where no laws
command them, to know, oh, to know everything for a
city’s good. I am not great enough. I am not—not
even <em>good</em> enough, Father.”</p>

<p>“But I think you are,” he told her.</p>

<p>She leaned toward him, her lips quivering, very
woman, veritable child.</p>

<p>“I would have to go away from Delphi. I would
never see Delphi again! I would never see <em>you</em> again!
Dear, dear Father, that would be like death!”</p>

<p>He put both arms about her and was not astonished
when she began to sob as if from some great shock or
strain.</p>

<p>“You will not command me to go,” she pleaded.
“Do not command me to go.”</p>

<p>“My dear child! Of course not against your will.
But do you not see the honour, the splendour of doing
this thing? Of making a city which shall be your
own, upon which you can stamp what character you
will?”</p>

<p>“I am not great enough to stamp character upon a
city. Oh, no, oh, no! Think if I should make some
mistake which would harm it, harm the people for
perhaps a hundred years. And, oh, I could never
think of any city as <em>my</em> city except my Delphi—my
Delphi,” she repeated with all the hereditary love,
the life-long worship sounding in the word.</p>

<p>Nikander was utterly puzzled.</p>

<p>“Are you only a woman, after all?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, Father, what should I be?” she asked
with innocent stare.</p>

<p>“Don’t you want your freedom?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_282"></a>[282]</span></p>

<p>“Freedom! oh, Father, at the price of exile?”</p>

<p>“Exile it is, if you so consider it,” he said. “There,
go to sleep again. I don’t believe you are half awake,
anyway.”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I am, I am awake.”</p>

<p>So he left her. Nikander’s mind was strangely
divided between relief and disappointment. Only a
woman, after all. Evidently Timon’s heroics were all
misplaced. She cared only for home and loved ones.
What young man but would have leaped to the task,
seen the honour, joyed in the responsibility? And
what should he say to the priests? How they would
laugh! He could hear Melas’s gibes. Timon would
get the brunt of it for proposing her name. Well,
after all, they both deserved it for believing such high
things of a mere girl.</p>

<p>Yet as Nikander composed himself to sleep he was
amazed at his curious sense of relief, an escape out of
sorrow. How lovingly she had flung herself into his
arms, and what an actual protection he had felt in
that love of hers—protection from loneliness, old age
... greyness of life.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Thus strangely did Theria receive the news of her
freedom. Like a bird born in a cage, she did not recognize
the open door. This amazing proposal had come
to Theria at the most sentimental hour of her life,
when the bride leaving her old home looks with vivid
tenderness upon it. These days the dear old home
did not imprison Theria. And the new one! With
what intense hope and wonder did that draw her on!</p>

<p>Perhaps she had not been fully awake talking with
her father. But surely she was awake now. She
began to toss and toss upon her bed. She was a little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
hurt that her father should so easily plan her departure
from Delphi.</p>

<p>“I thought he knew how I loved the Oracle,” she
reflected. “But he does not know. Because I am
not Dryas, nor Timon—because I am not a man,
Father thinks I cannot feel as he does. But I do, I do.”</p>

<p>She sat up in bed, gazing into the dark.</p>

<p>“I have helped Delphi,” she murmured, rather
miserably. “At least I thought I had helped Delphi by
my oracles. Shall I not love my city that I have
helped?”</p>

<p>The miraculous saving of Delphi after days of
danger, Theria’s vision on the mountain—all had intensified
her already ardent love of home. Even her
god Apollo was locally peculiar to his shrine. Gods
were never quite the same when worshipped in distant
temples. Apollo of Delphi was nearer to Theria than
Apollo anywhere else. No, no, how strange of her father
to propose her going away. And he wanted her to
found a city! The greatness of the task appalled her.
She lay back with a sigh.</p>

<p>Inessa! What did the city look like, lying ruined
on its distant shore?—“The most beautiful shore in the
world,” her father had called it. Apollo himself must
love that city since he so insisted upon its rebuilding.
A great mountain rose behind it, greater than Parnassos.
This also her father had told her. She began
again to wonder who could be selected to rebuild it.
No doubt the priests had looked over the whole field
and found no one. That was why they had chosen
her. There could be no other reason for such choosing.
Well, they would fall back upon Karamanor. Karamanor
had commercial talent. Theria had always
heard of that, and how from a little boy he had always<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
got the best of it in every enterprise. Karamanor
would make Inessa prosperous, send her ships over
farthest waters, and make her rich as Sybaris. Oh,
but that was not what the god wanted! There were
plenty of rich colonies in the west. No, surely Apollo
had some great entity for Inessa. An <i>eidolon</i> she
called it, a spiritual ideal or image containing the
force and character of the god himself. Beauty rising
from it to meet the beauty of the divine mind. Song
in abundance fostered, almost worshipped, there.
Beauty of dance and of perfectly formed high-hearted
youths. Justice, yes, even to the poor who expect no
just dealings. And perhaps some new Philosophy
which the god had stored in his heart to give to some
philosopher yet unborn and who could be born only
in this new place of free speech and high ideals, this
place untrammelled by old-world mistakes. She thought
of Pythagoras, Parmenides. Yes, it was from the
west that the philosopher came and awakened the
minds of men.</p>

<p>Oh, who could tell what the god of pure, unutterable
beauty might do if only the place were prepared?
Inessa was a god-appointed place, a god-appointed task.
But Karamanor could not do it.</p>

<p>Then? What then?</p>

<p>It was <em>her</em> task. <em>Theria’s!</em> God-given!</p>

<p>She was unworthy, unable! Yes, yes, but the god
would help her. Had he not always helped? Ah, out
of such difficulties, such despairs, always that hand
reached down, always that sudden brightness of mind
which was the god’s presence.</p>

<p>She seemed to see Inessa on its shore forlorn, waiting
for her!</p>

<p>She leaped from her bed and stood trembling in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
darkness. What had she done? She had sent her
father away; she had refused! A sentimental, maudlin
refusal! Oh, if her father had only shaken her. He
was too gentle these days, was Father. She must tell
him quickly, quickly. She must tell him she would go.</p>

<p>She felt her way to the door, then hurried along the
balcony to her father’s room. He was in the heavy first
sleep of night, and when she spoke to him he did not
arouse, but only sighed wearily. Melantho sat up.
“Are you ill? Is it robbers?” she asked. And learning
it was neither she rated Theria in wrathful whispers
for disturbing the head of the house.</p>

<p>So Theria perforce went back to her room, there to
toss, to plan, to wonder, until nearly dawn when she
fell, as with a sudden stumble, into slumber.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>When she awoke again the full sun was shining
brightly into the court. Inessa, the new wonderful
colony, met her awaking mind. She had been walking
in its streets of dream with Eëtíon.</p>

<p>But she knew that Nikander always rose with the
dawn. Already he might be gone from the house to
tell the priests to choose another leader. In mad haste
she threw on her chiton and hurried down into the
aula. Paian be praised! Nikander was still there, but
all dressed and sandalled going toward the door.</p>

<p>“Father, Father!” she cried breathlessly. “Wait a
moment. Oh, I must see you alone.”</p>

<p>“What has happened?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Inessa! Oh, Father, I am going to Inessa. I must
go.”</p>

<p>“What,” he smiled at her vehemence. “Changeable
woman! Do you expect me to veer about with all
your moods?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span></p>

<p>“I didn’t listen. I was blind. I——”</p>

<p>“But perhaps I, too, have changed mood. I am not
nearly so eager as I was last night, my daughter.”</p>

<p>He was not teasing. He meant it! There were longing
and affection in his face before which she was utterly
silent.</p>

<p>Then he looked into her eyes.</p>

<p>“Does the colony seem more possible this morning?”
he asked seriously.</p>

<p>“Possible! Oh, the wonderful task! God-given.
Are you sure, sure the priests meant it for me?”</p>

<p>“Quite sure. It was a long, serious discussion.”</p>

<p>“There is no one else,” she said humbly. “That is
why they chose me. And that is why I must go.
Inessa seems as if it were my own child, lonely, ruined,
waiting for me.”</p>

<p>“Hmm—so that is your meaning this morning.”</p>

<p>She began to pace up and down. “Father, it is a
thousand-fold task, the founding of a city.”</p>

<p>“I should rather think so,” he smiled.</p>

<p>“Would I have the choice of men who are to go?
It should be but a few men at first, and the right men.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the choice would be yours.”</p>

<p>“And the present site of the city. May I choose
another? If the old site be unhealthful, or melancholy,
or not beautiful, or haunted by some fate?”</p>

<p>“Yes, with the consent of the colonists.”</p>

<p>“And the laws of the city. Would I select the code
and even annul laws that proved unsuited in the new
land? Oh, Father, you will have to teach me. I will
have to work every moment to grow wiser and better.”</p>

<p>“I will teach you,” he responded, wondering at her.</p>

<p>“Think, if we could make a new city where better
justice would be meted out than ever before, where<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
even the poor man could keep up heart and courage.
And where orphans would be nurtured. Oh, nobody
should care for the little fatherless children but me.
I would let no one else do that.”</p>

<p>She stopped her pacing and faced him. He was
amazed at the change in her—a look of release, of
purpose in her face that had never been there before.
Seeing her eyes so shining, he realized that always heretofore
they had held a bafflement, a look of discouragement
and hunger. That look was gone. Now she was
strangely creative, maternal onward-moving. The very
lift of her head was free. He seemed to see a new
Theria.</p>

<p>“Daughter,” Nikander said, “I did not, no, I did
not realize it would mean all this to you.”</p>

<p>“Dear Father, dear Father,” she said.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Nikander at once plunged into the further details of
the colony. Theria’s enthusiasm was contagious. She
listened to him, absorbed. Suddenly she stopped him.</p>

<p>“Of course Eëtíon knows of my leadership? He approves?”</p>

<p>“I did not see him, Daughter. I came hot-foot to
you.”</p>

<p>“But Eëtíon should have known it first of all.” Her
eyes looked startled, then deep trouble entered into
them. “Suppose he does not wish to go?”</p>

<p>“But he will go, Daughter. I am sure he will.”</p>

<p>“I am not sure, not sure,” was her troubled answer.
“Eëtíon has been so beaten about the world. He is
so pathetically glad to be here at home in Hellas.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make him go,” laughed Nikander.</p>

<p>“Oh, but that is not what I want. No, Eëtíon, too,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
must be happy. If he were saddened, all the joy would
go out of the work; I would lose my luck.”</p>

<p>“Oh, but he’ll go for your sake.”</p>

<p>She seemed not to hear him.</p>

<p>“Father”—she turned to him with sudden pleading—“may
I not see Eëtíon? I long to see him now—<em>now</em>.
What foolishness to keep us apart. We are
betrothed, Eëtíon and I.”</p>

<p>“But I can tell him about the colony.”</p>

<p>“No, no, I must tell him myself. Please, Father,
please!”</p>

<p>He could not resist her pleading. He kissed her.
“Impetuous daughter,” he called her. But he went
forth to find Eëtíon.</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Theria</span> was heroic no longer. She ran to find
Baltè.</p>

<p>“Baltè, dress me quick, quick,” she commanded.
“No, in my festival dress, the white one
with the purple-flowered border. And I want the
lovely big necklace, too, with the golden shells and
amethysts.”</p>

<p>Theria’s fingers trembled as she helped to fasten the
robe.</p>

<p>“Eëtíon is coming,” she whispered. “Oh, he may
be here any moment.”</p>

<p>But many moments passed and even hours. Theria
went now to the upper window, now down to the door,
thinking she had seen Eëtíon on the road, now back
into the court.</p>

<p>“Why doesn’t he come?” she said despairingly.
“Oh, he is against the colony. Father is trying to
persuade him. That is what keeps them. It could be
nothing else. Perhaps Eëtíon will not let me go at all.”</p>

<p>Theria had lived so long in half serfdom that she
could not, save in certain burning moments, credit her
freedom to do this thing. At last Baltè tried to
persuade her to eat her breakfast.</p>

<p>“You are famished, darling,” quoth the nurse.
“How pale you are. Your lover must not see you so
pale.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span></p>

<p>But Theria could not eat. She was sitting hopeless
at the little table in the court when, with quiet suddenness,
the door opened and Eëtíon was there. She
rose, trembling, paler than ever. She did not move.
Eëtíon ran to her.</p>

<p>“You are ill, darling? Why did you send for me? Ah,
Theria, Theria, to see you, to see you!” And he
kissed her again and again, so that she had no time to
answer.</p>

<p>He had been out hunting, Eëtíon told her. He had
returned to find the slave with her message. Oh,
why had she given him this unlooked-for joy?</p>

<p>Then brokenly, trying not to plead either in voice
or look, Theria told him of the colony and that her
father wished to make her <i>oekist</i>—the leader of the
colony.</p>

<p>“We must not go unless you wish to go, Eëtíon,” she
finished. “It will mean hardships again for you, pioneer
life away from your art and the beautiful things
that are your very life. It would put you far from
Hellas when you have had to wander so many years.”</p>

<p>For his sake she saw Inessa as it really was—a ruin
on a desolate shore, a struggle for mere subsistence,
a fight with Nature and with human foes.</p>

<p>But Eëtíon noted only one thing.</p>

<p>“You would be <i>oekist</i>?” he asked, amazed.</p>

<p>“Yes, you and I together.”</p>

<p>“They would place that great task in your hands?
Would the priests really do that?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” she breathed.</p>

<p>“Oh,” he broke out. “It is better than anything I
ever hoped for you. It is——”</p>

<p>She glanced up at him with such sudden relief that
her eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span></p>

<p>“Look here, you little child,” spoke Eëtíon quickly.
“What have you been thinking?”</p>

<p>“I thought——” Theria stopped.</p>

<p>“You thought I might take away your gift? That I,
your lover, your betrothed, and therefore your lawful
master, would snatch your freedom away?”</p>

<p>He took her right hand, holding it against his breast,
now bending to kiss it.</p>

<p>“Theria,” he said soberly, “you haven’t begun to
understand my love, not even begun to understand
it.”</p>

<p>“Do you mean that you really wish me to reach out—to—to
find joy in something beyond my home and
children—beyond you, you, too?”</p>

<p>Eëtíon paused a moment in a sort of amazed impatience
with her.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that what I have been telling you in as many
ways as I knew how, ever since I first caught sight of
you?” he inquired.</p>

<p>“I didn’t believe you.”</p>

<p>“Do you now?”</p>

<p>She looked, her eyes so deep with gratitude that he
caught his breath.</p>

<p>“It will never be beyond you, Eëtíon. My whole life
goes to you and there rests.”</p>

<p>“And you gave me my freedom. It’s there that my
love rests.”</p>

<p>“But that was so easy to do. Who would not have
done it?”</p>

<p>“Nobody but you, Theria. And with what quickness
you did it, so spontaneously, so effectively—just you,
you! Darling, I would live my life on a frozen coast
if that were the only way to give you, too, the gift of
freedom.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span></p>

<p>“But you must be happy,” she insisted. “Can’t
you see I cannot be glad unless——”</p>

<p>“Yes, yes, I am happy,” he interrupted her. “Theria,
have you ever thought how humiliating it is to be a
metic? In Argos I belonged to an honoured clan. Here
in Delphi I am a metic, an alien, nor can I ever be otherwise.
In the new city I will be a citizen—the first
citizen of all.”</p>

<p>“Eëtíon!” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>He drew her close, speaking low and earnestly:</p>

<p>“And our children will be citizens also. They will
inherit. In the new city my sons shall hold up their
heads.”</p>

<p>When Nikander came in a half hour later he found the
two lovers bending over a pottery tile on which was a
map.</p>

<p>Theria leaped up, clapping her hands like a child.</p>

<p>“He will go, he will go,” she cried.</p>

<p>“Did I not tell you that he would?” answered Nikander
quietly.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE MARRIAGE</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">In the</span> pleasant sunset hour there was great excitement
in Delphi village. Men and women of the
aristocratic families of the town were all upon the
street. Since women were abroad, it could be nothing
other than a wedding. Nikander’s daughter to be
married! And the circumstances were so unusual that
not one relative would miss it. Nikander was marrying
her to a foreigner, a strange choice where Delphic
youths abounded. But it was said that the choice was
the girl’s own, that she loved the young man.</p>

<p>She had managed to see him, and the young man had
seen Theria’s face not once, but twice. This, however,
was stoutly denied by the nearest of kin. The bridegroom
had some wealth. That was a comfort; but he
was as peculiar as the girl herself.</p>

<p>The girl had seen Apollo in a vision and was now
going to carry the god’s worship over seas to a place
where Polyphemus, the one-eyed giant, still lived and
might at any time sally forth from some sequestered
forest. Where also were men with heads turned backward.
This from the women. The men knew better.</p>

<p>So they all gathered to the festive house with laughter,
cousinly greetings, and jests. Nikander, richly clad
and crowned with myrtle, received them at the door.
Ah, there was the bridegroom, too. He was certainly
handsome even though no Delphian. His dark head<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
was crowned. He was clad in the crimson purple so
dear to the Greeks. And here was Dryas, limping from
his honourable wounds and greeting them all in his
friendly way. How bright the torches burned in the
aula! The smell of roast lamb was wafted from the
kitchen to mingle with the odour of rose garlands everywhere.
The slaves were bringing in the wine. Would
the bride come soon?</p>

<p>In the midst of this worldly clatter the love that was
between the pair burned, a thing apart like an altar
flame on a still day, clear, unswerving toward the sky.</p>

<p>The ceremonies had begun in the morning when Nikander
sacrificed the lamb to Hera Teleia. In the afternoon
had come Theria’s maiden cousin bearing a
pitcher of pure water from Castalia spring. Theria
had received her bridal bath knowing that at the spring
itself Eëtíon likewise was being purified.</p>

<p>Theria had been all joy, full of excited laughter,
pranks, and dancing. But now her joy swept into an
exaltation which kept her still and wistfully kind to all
who served her.</p>

<p>As said her own Greek poet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">Young life grows in those sheltered regions of its own,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And the sungod’s heat vexes it not,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Nor rain nor any wind</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">But it rejoices in its sweet untroubled being.</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Toward evening her mother and Baltè dressed
Theria in her robes. They draped her beauty in the
bridal saffron in which it glowed, they crowned her
dark head with myrtle, accenting its symmetry. Then
they covered all with the bridal veil and took her below
into the torch-lighted aula.</p>

<p>Sorry might those well be who missed the wonder of
her hidden eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span></p>

<p>The guests received her with shouts and laughter.
For the wedding was a revel and a romp, the subject
of raillery and joke. The women sat at table apart;
the men at their feast table. How merrily they
laughed when Eëtíon kept glancing away from the
board toward his bride and forgot to talk. It was not
the bride’s beauty but Eëtíon’s which was remarked
by the guests.</p>

<p>So they drank the wine and poured it to the gods,
and flung it each in turn from his glass into a whirling
cup. Whoever flung without spilling won a prize.</p>

<p>The young couple, in spite of their curious history,
made a good impression upon the guests, and several
that evening asked to become members of the new
colony.</p>

<p>Then in the midst of the <i>kottabus</i> game went up the
shout:</p>

<p>“The marriage car at the door!”</p>

<p>Only a moment had Theria to gaze about her at
the dear familiar place seen all dimly through her veil.
Then her mother took her hand and led her out into
the coolness of the night.</p>

<p>There the full round of the marriage-moon made a
whiter day. Eëtíon lifted his bride, a slim, swathed
figure, into the chariot, then sat at her side. Karamanor,
as paranymphos, sat with them.</p>

<p>The procession started, Melantho behind the chariot
carrying the marriage torches whose ruddy burning
sent aloft the mystic smoke. Out from the house into
the silvery radiance of the moon-lit road poured forth
the youths and maidens, singing, shouting:</p>

<p>“Ho Hymen! Hymen Hymenæos. Io!”</p>

<p>Up the Delphi highroad they danced toward the little
house beyond the Precinct, which Nikander had given<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
to the pair. A mad and merry rout, they followed the
jolting car. One played the sounding pipes, and behind
him a boy clashed aloft the thin, glittering cymbals.
In a burst of joyous music they stopped at the
bridegroom’s door.</p>

<p>There stood Baltè with torches to receive them.
Eëtíon’s mother should have been the one to hold that
welcoming torch. No doubt she guessed this in her
dark house of Hades and wept with tearless eyes to be
near her son upon his marriage night.</p>

<p>Now Eëtíon lifts his bride from the chariot, carries
her carefully over the high threshold that no stumble
of her foot may bring ill luck. And they go into the
marriage chamber. The door is shut and Eëtíon with
reverent hand lifts the bridal veil to behold at last the
wondering, half-frightened, yet happy face for which
he has longed these many days.</p>

<p>Soberly he gives to her the quince, symbolic food of
those who are to be the mothers of men. Her hands, as
she eats, tangle in the long enmeshing veil, and with a
quick breath Eëtíon sweeps it off upon the floor. Her
comely head is liberate, her shoulders and arms free.</p>

<p>Suddenly he catches her away from ritual into a
high shining reality. He folds her in his arms, kissing
her forehead and mouth.</p>

<p>“Oh, be free,” he whispers. “Your hands to act,
your eyes to see, my Theria, giver of my freedom.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Meanwhile, the guests outside the closed door make
merry, chanting the epithalamion, calling rudely to the
bridal pair as the ancient custom is, but they—they
hear it not.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DOOR OF ESCAPE</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">Then</span> followed a busy, happy winter. All the
months must be passed in making ready the
colony which was to start with the early navigation
of the spring. Eëtíon journeyed to his old home
in Argos, and found there, as he had expected, certain
citizens who were faithful to Hellas and secretly grieving
over Argos’s faithless stand in the war.</p>

<p>Xerxes, the Persian king, was gone from Greece.
But a formidable army of Persians yet lingered in
Greece. Before these were vanquished fighting was
yet to be—and these few Argive men were horrified
at the prospect of fighting against their own. They
returned with Eëtíon to Delphi. Theria tested these
men, shrewdly asking them questions, watching their
faces. Eëtíon, spite of experience, was a less keen
judge than she. From wrong premises she was
continually drawing right conclusions. After trying to
help her Eëtíon gave up, laughing. The feminine way
was new.</p>

<p>In Delphi itself, Karamanor and Agis and a number
of other kinsmen were glad to go. Those who were not
married took brides forthwith. The new generation
in the colony would have a strong Delphic stamp.
Here was more business for the <i>œkist</i>, for not a bride
among them wanted to go. Theria visited from one to
the other, picturing the new life, persuading them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span></p>

<p>“No one in the colony shall be homesick if I can
help it,” she told them. And remembering her own
first reluctance to go, she could not be hard upon their
timidity. Theria had never known girl-friends, but in
these earnest conferences she acquired them. One
little wife in particular—a girl of fourteen years, delicate,
pale, whose father had been very severe and
whose husband was now taking his turn at severity—Theria
took to her heart with great tenderness. She
was herself astonished at the way the little creature
bloomed and grew strong under the new encouragement.</p>

<p>And now Theria must receive the grain to be laden
in the ships, grain both for food and for planting.
Theria tended the tiny grape-vines and treasured the
seeds of useful herbs and vegetables to be carried over
seas. No seeds of flowers, for the Greeks did not
plant them. Besides, were not the slopes and capes of
Sicily one far-flung flowerland?</p>

<p>As for Nikander, the days were not long enough for
him to teach his daughter all she now must know: the
Delphic laws, the modes of city government, precautions
for city health, religious customs in which she
must be vigilant and exacting. Her hungry learning
brought tears to Nikander’s eyes. But often these
were tears of pride for the quickness of her mind, her
strong opinion so intimately his own, her quick refusal
of wrong methods or shallow reasoning.</p>

<p>But it was perhaps Melantho who in these days noted
the greatest change in Theria. Theria had always been
haughty toward her mother, disobedient, and sharp of
answer.</p>

<p>Melantho’s commonplaceness, her willingness for the
jog-trot woman’s life exasperated her daughter; and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
when Melantho had tried to make the daughter keep
to the same dull pace there had arisen quarrels and
bitterness.</p>

<p>But in these days of free outlet Theria grew gentle
toward her mother. Affectionate, though a little condescending
withal as daughters are apt to be. Then
while Theria was yet unaware the affection grew into
respect for the stubby little figure that went pottering
around the house making content out of such meagre
materials. Homespuns, tapestries, embroidered things—these
were Melantho’s joy. These like the gay
patch-work quilts of a later day were the spirit-outlets
for a housed woman.</p>

<p>One day timidly she brought forth to her daughter a
balcony hanging—a gorgeous thing. The little human
figures wrought upon it told an ancient legend lost
save that this ancient woven design preserved it to
memory and men’s eyes. The little men and women
were archaic, almost grotesque, but perfect in decorative
value. For in Hellas even such delicate, perishable
things took on the inevitable beauty which flowed from
Greek souls through their fingers.</p>

<p>Melantho spread it before Theria on a table.</p>

<p>“Do you like it?” she asked.</p>

<p>“It is beautiful—beautiful,” said Theria, passing a
caressing hand over the deep reds and gorgeous peacock-blues.
“Do you know, Mother, whenever this was
hung from the balcony when I was a little child I used
to shout and prance with joy. Many a time you
punished me and did not know why I was noisy.”</p>

<p>Melantho looked down.</p>

<p>“How strange,” she said. “It always makes me
feel that way, too.”</p>

<p>“You, Mother! <em>You!</em>”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span></p>

<p>“Of course,” corrected Melantho, “I never did it. I
never pranced.”</p>

<p>Theria laughed a thrill of affectionate laughter. “I
wish you had,” she declared.</p>

<p>“I was wondering,” said Melantho, hesitating, “if
you would not take this with you to your new home.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t think of taking it,” said Theria. “It is
too precious. And it belongs here in the dear old home
where it has always been.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Melantho. “The ship will be crowded
with useful things which you really need.”</p>

<p>Something in Melantho’s face, as she gathered the
folds together, caught Theria.</p>

<p>“Mother! Do you really want me to take it? You
are willing to part with it?” she exclaimed.</p>

<p>Melantho paused in her timid way.</p>

<p>“You dear Mother,” said Theria, shaking her
mother’s shoulders in affectionate protest. “Don’t
you suppose I’d rather have it than a hundred merely
useful things? I hated to be selfish.”</p>

<p>Melantho’s face shone. “I have so many more.”</p>

<p>“But none so glorious as this one, Mother. Oh, at
first, when I have only a little hut, and hang this in it,
it will be home. And, Mother, I’ll feel, when my babies
are born and see this, that they will be seeing something
that is really Delphi!—Delphi!”</p>

<p>“Perhaps other children,” ventured Melantho,
“other children of the colony will see it, too. The
town will be so poor and bare at first. Nothing
beautiful, nothing——” Melantho was quite unresigned
to Theria’s going, could see no possible reason for it.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Theria conceded. “It will be all of that,
huts and mere shelters at first. But it will never look
like that to me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span></p>

<p>“Yes, but the children who are too little to remember
Delphi,” objected Melantho. “How will it look to
them?”</p>

<p>“I will bring them to see this. Yes, I will. Until
our temples are built and my dear Eëtíon makes
statues of gods and men. Only think, Mother, it will be
your gift—the gift of your fingers—which will keep
alive our heritage of beauty, until the town brings it to
life again in itself.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many a long hour did Nikander, Eëtíon, and Theria
together study the maps of the western colonies.</p>

<p>“You see,” said Nikander one day, “by this map
how near Inessa lies to her unkind neighbour, Catana.
That is a problem for you, Theria, for you also, Eëtíon.”</p>

<p>But Eëtíon was studying the map with knitted brows.</p>

<p>“I wish it showed whether marble is found there,”
he said. “Do you suppose Syracuse would furnish
bronze?”</p>

<p>Nikander clapped him on the shoulder, laughing.</p>

<p>“Oh, incorrigible sculptor, what did you promise
me?” he asked.</p>

<p>Eëtíon blushed like a boy. “In the new city,” he
pleaded, “surely my fault will be overlooked.”</p>

<p>“As leader in the new city,” responded Nikander,
“you should set an example to all.”</p>

<p>“Isn’t that rather <em>an</em> undertaking, Nikander?”
sighed the rueful artist.</p>

<p>But Theria took Eëtíon’s brown, skilful hand in hers.</p>

<p>“Nay, Father,” she said defensively. “Deny him not.
He is a born sculptor, his gift is from the gods. We cannot
stop it. As for me, I have been inquiring among the
colonists. I have found several bronze workers, and
workers of marble. These shall be Eëtíon’s helpers.”</p>

<span class="smaller">ALIEN MEADOWS</span></h3>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">In the</span> early spring six good ships rode at anchor in
the harbour of Kirrha. They were the small craft
of that day. Hardy the folk who would put to sea
in them.</p>

<p>In Delphi the good-byes were earnest and tearful.
Many were the anxious sacrifices paid for the safe
voyaging, many the omens taken, peering into the
future. It is said that in those days more than a third
of all navigation went to the bottom. It was a far
journey. The smallness and slowness of the craft
multiplied the distance a hundred-fold.</p>

<p>At last one bright spring morning Eëtíon and Theria,
hand in hand, and the little band of colonists following
them, started down the hill road toward Kirrha.
Melantho could not bring herself to go to the port,
could not bear to see her daughter actually lose herself
upon the sea. But Nikander walked wordless beside
his daughter.</p>

<p>Here was Theria’s first viewing of the sea, a small
stretch of intense blue far on the horizon between the
hills. In the journey down from Delphi the dreamy
hills unfold and stand aside in delicate succession
until all the violet Gulf of Corinth is open to the view.
Eëtíon quietly put aside Theria’s veil as the first
glimpse of it opened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span></p>

<p>“The sea!” he said with that love in his voice that
every Greek understood.</p>

<p>The little company passed slowly down the steep
olive grove and came at last to the small port of Kirrha.</p>

<p>Ah, how impatient the bright ships pull at their anchors—birds
impatient to be gone! Bright they are as
birds in their plumage—red and peacock-blue. The
grotesque prows dance as if alive. One prow is a
boar, another a goose, another a huge bird, all dipping
in the waves. At the hawse holes of each ship are two
bright orange-coloured eyes—how else can they see their
way across the misty deep? Four are merchant vessels,
the so-called “round ships,” built for cargo and for
steady going. These have a single oblong sail and
eight or ten long sweeps to help the windless days or
days of contrary winds.</p>

<p>The other two ships are triremes, necessary for defense
in those western waters where pirates are to be
dealt with. These long narrow ships, with three tiers
of oars either side and a sharp beak, are built for war.
Indeed, one of them has fought in the battle of Salamis,
an actual helper in the freedom of Greece and well-nigh
sacred. Theria, Eëtíon, and their kinsfolk are to go in
her.</p>

<p>Nikander kisses his daughter and weeps like a child
now in this last moment of good-bye. Theria clings to
him in the sharpest sorrow she has ever known.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>With laughter and tears the colonists set forth in
tiny rowboats and climb aboard. Theria as <i>œkist</i>,
a figure of white fluttering garments, standing on the
deck of her ship, lights the incense upon the little altar
there. The oarmasters lift their hands as one would
start a chorus, the flute player begins to play a wild,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
rhythmic tune. Now a shout! and the three tiers of
oars either side the ship lift—grating, groaning, creaking—a
mighty noise. Then all together, like huge
powerful wings, they smite down upon the water which
whitens into spray.</p>

<p>Forth springs the trireme like a hound, half lost in
its own glittering spume. Up go the yellow sails of the
round boats. A cry of love and longing goes up from
the dear ones ashore, and the colonists are off!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All that day the little fleet coasted along the Gulf of
Corinth, one of the most picturesque inland waters in
the world. At night they drew up their ships upon
the shore and slept under the stars. Sunrise saw them
off again, the round boats using their long sweeps in
that still, golden hour.</p>

<p>All the way, as was the Greek fashion, they hugged
the shore along Ætolia, Akarnania, Epeiros, keeping
within the islands for safety, arriving at Corcyra, that
western outlook-isle of Greece, the fourth day.</p>

<p>From Corcyra they made the bold voyage across
the Ionian Sea to Italy.</p>

<p>Theria’s mind, so cultivated yet unspoiled, so educated
yet starved, viewed all things with an eagerness
usual to a child of seven. Partly her cloistering had
done this, partly it was a racial characteristic. The
Hellene was always young, and in this the Nikander
family were true Hellenes.</p>

<p>Day after day she stood at the prow, never tiring of
the broad and changing sea, of the islands, white peaked
or lying like brazen shields on the glancing deep, of the
dolphins that played about the ship—symbols of her
god—of the rise of the moon like a full-opened lonely
flower above the waste of waters. She asked questions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span>
of Eëtíon constantly like a child, and who so glad as he
to answer? Eëtíon was her Odysseus who knew all
the wonders of travel, its dangers and its joys.</p>

<p>In the Gulf of Tarentum they met storms which
drove the fleet apart. One of the ships was lost and
Theria wept for it as for close kindred. They reached
Italy, coasted down to the point of it, sighted Sicily the
great Isle of Snowy Peaks and came at evening, as is the
wondrous way of ships, into the tiny bay of their desire.</p>

<p>It was Eëtíon and Theria who stepped down first
from the galley and waded through the shallows to the
shore. Together they stooped and kissed the alien
land which was to become their own. In spite of all
their cultivation, they were not farther from the soil
than the hidden creatures of wood and field.</p>

<p>Then the ships were beached. What sound is so
exquisite of far meaning as this grating of a glad prow
upon new sands? The Greeks climbed the shore
talking eagerly, laughing, looking about them as only
new emigrants look, with hope of future generations
in their eyes.</p>

<p>Karamanor and Agis, as priests of Apollo, builded an
altar, scattered barley and poured wine, lighting the
fire with the sacred flames which they had brought from
Delphi and had carefully guarded all the voyage
through. But this done, Theria made them hide their
fire for fear of being seen. Their foe, alas, was no
Sicilian, but the Greek town Catana which flourished
farther up the coast. So they ate a frugal supper and
wearily, thankfully, slept on the lonely sand.</p>

<p>Next morning, before sunrise, Theria awoke and
spoke to Eëtíon.</p>

<p>“Come,” she whispered. “Let us go into the land
and see what we may see.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span></p>

<p>“We must leave Karamanor in charge,” answered
Eëtíon. “They must not think us lost.”</p>

<p>This matter accomplished, they stole hand in hand
out of the sleeping camp and up the overgrown paths
toward the ruined town. The enemy had done his
work well. The town was a pitiful sight. Greek, and
ruined by Greeks.</p>

<p>They passed beyond the town into the upland meadows
where carpets of anemones—purple, white, and
pink—reminded them that here the maid Persephone
had gathered flowers what time the dark steeds of
Hades and his yet darker chariot came rattling down
upon her. The place seemed utterly deserted. All
distances were hid in mists. The dews and high
grasses drenched them to the knees. Theria had to
kirtle her dress as she had done in the glen at home.
But with this freedom her spirit rose. She began to go
more eagerly, leaping along the way, clapping her hands
at each new stretch of bloom, breaking into snatches of
old Delphic song. Eëtíon began almost to fear that
she was too much a child, that no responsibility had
really touched her.</p>

<p>“Ah, well,” he thought tenderly, “I can take the
care. After all, her years are child years only.”</p>

<p>They began to climb the hills and into a brightening
world. Now turning they could see the beach with its
faint dark patch where was their camp. But the ships
were hid in the little river which here emptied into the
sea.</p>

<p>Full morning now. They came to a pleasant hill.
It jutted out like a headland into a fertile, untilled vale.
A forest of cypress and wild olive crowned the hill,
and the shade received them with a sense of rest.</p>

<p>But Theria did not rest. She began to explore. And<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span>
in a depression of the hillside she came upon a full
flowing spring. With a hasty invocation she knelt to
drink and as she did so, the birds flew up in flocks with
a whir of wings.</p>

<p>Instantly she recalled the oracle which had been
given to the Sicilian youth, Hyllos.</p>

    <div class="verse indent0">Rebuild your city upon a hill,</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>“Eëtíon, Eëtíon,” she called, and as he and the slave
came running:</p>

<p>“Oh, I have found the site of our city, truly, I think
I have found it!”</p>

<p>Reverently they drank of the spring. How unbelievably
sweet after the stale water of the ship.</p>

<p>“It tastes like our own Castalia water,” she said.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mistress, it <em>is</em> Castaly,” spoke the Delphic slave.
“I’d know Castalia water anywhere. The dear nymph
has come under the sea to greet us here.” And Theria
believed him.</p>

<p>“Eëtíon, come, look! Is not the hill defensible
from every side? Is not the plain near enough for
tillage? You know so much better than I. Is it not
better to be here hidden among the hills than down on
the shore where the enemy will find us too soon?”</p>

<p>She was serious (no laughter now) and sharp as a
hawk.</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said Eëtíon. Busily, carefully they
searched the place.</p>

<p>Then they halted as if at some command.</p>

<p>The mist had been drawing off, and suddenly borne
upon the clouds the glorious snowy crest of Ætna stood
in the sky, its white steam floating from it as if it itself
would float away into nothingness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span></p>

<p>Then far below the rugged coast-line trembled into
view and all the blue sea.</p>

<p>Theria closed her eyes at the pain of the too-great
beauty.</p>

<p>“The gods have spoken,” said Eëtíon softly. “We
will go back and tell our people. We have found the
site of our city.”</p>

</div>

<p class="dropcap"><span class="word1">How</span> eagerly the colonists heard the story. How
impatiently they hurried up to the place themselves.</p>

<p>Some were at first not satisfied with the site—those
who had always lived directly upon the seashore. But
in the council which met under the trees the Delphian
mountain dwellers prevailed.</p>

<p>Next day all began to carry their goods to Theria’s
hill and started their work.</p>

<p>First must come the wall. All laboured at this, slave
and free; for the thing was of moment. Huts and
shelters of branches must serve the people for this first
while.</p>

<p>Then the temple of Apollo was begun at once and of
marble. In this work Eëtíon was perfectly happy.
He it was who selected the temple-site. With true
Greek instinct he made the temple the focus of the
landscape, the place toward which everything centred,
hill and vale and reverent climbing path.</p>

<p>It was Eëtíon who later modelled the sculptures of
the pediment and the bronze image of the youthful
Apollo which was to stand within.</p>

<p>Indeed the town was a place of youth. No grey
heads anywhere, no blasted hopes nor pent-up desires.
And when these are absent no one can believe that they
ever will come!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span></p>

<p>So well did the sequestered situation serve them that
their enemy, the Catanan neighbours, found them not
until months had passed. And when they did find
them, the new colonists drove them off in a quick
fight.</p>

<p>Theria’s hours were full. Those hours which at
home used to drag in hated vacancy. The colonists
themselves were Theria’s constant care. To one she
gave ardent praise, to another, merited rebuke.</p>

<p>The choosing of laws, the unexpected setting aside
of old laws which in this new land were found to be
ill-fitted, the keeping of the council high purposed and
pure. These were her duties. Theria did not sit with
the council, but her advice was paramount. As former
priestess of Apollo and seer of a vision, she exercised a
power which as mere woman she could never have
attained.</p>

<p>And strangely enough, her poet quality did not suffer
in this public activity, but, as is frequent with the
Greek, rather thrived and flowered in it.</p>

<p>Late in the winter her first child was born. The
colonists thought it was misfortune that the child
should be a girl. But Eëtíon took this dispensation of
the gods with good heart. He lifted the darling creature
in his arms, gazing into the tiny face which, from its
first hour, knew how to smile.</p>

<p>Then, smiling himself, he draped the little thing in a
long, old-fashioned string of pearls and laid her softly
beside her mother.</p>

<p>“But what is this?” asked Theria. “In what strange
fashion have you decked my child?”</p>

<p>He laughed with happiness. “Do you not recognize
them, dear Theria? The jewels of my freedom which
your eldest daughter must wear. Did I not purchase<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
them from Apollo and bring them over seas in hope of
her?”</p>

<p>And Theria realized how Eëtíon loved his little girl.</p>

<p>In the second spring came a shipload of Athenians to
join the colony. They gave the town a new impress
from the first moment of arrival. For who should
arrive with them but Nikander himself.</p>

<p>Theria was sitting crooning happily to her child when
he stepped over her high threshold as casually and unannounced
as though he had come from next door.
Theria came near fainting at such unlooked-for joy.
Absence in those days was deathlike in its completeness
and disconnection. It seemed to Theria as though her
dear father had come from the dead.</p>

<p>Then with what happy tears and soft laughter did
she lift up the baby Theria to show him. With what
pride did she lead her father out into her town.</p>

<p>Eëtíon met them at the doorway. Then with what
seriousness and pride did the two lead Nikander about
the new streets, to the market place, to their pure
Castalian spring, to their Akropolis. Here was the
temple, Eëtíon’s own. It stood unfinished, without
cella or roof, with distant Ætna and the violet horizon
of sea glimpsing between the white new columns. It
seemed a spirit thing, not yet quite of this earth. Indeed
it was never to be other than a heavenly, unbelievable
beauty.</p>

<p>In Eëtíon’s workshop stood his clay Apollo
watching as with wistful, marvelling eyes while the
craftsmen brought him to life in bronze. Beside it was
another model at sight of which Nikander exclaimed
aloud with pleasure.</p>

<p>“It is a Victory,” explained Eëtíon, “which I made
after our battle with the Catanans.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span></p>

<p>It was a slender elastic figure, winged, the accepted
victory form. Like the Ladas model she was moving
strongly forward, moving as it seemed into the wind
which swept back her long draperies in lovely, free,
yet simple lines. She held her victory trumpet but
had forgotten to sound it. Her dreamy face seemed
looking through some parting of the mists and she was
walking straight into her vision. She had forgotten present
victory in victories to be. The figure, the countenance,
the clean-shaped, filleted head were Theria’s
own.</p>

<p>“How did you ever capture her?” cried Nikander.
“The very spirit of my Theria.”</p>

<p>“She stood so at the prow of the ship,” said Eëtíon
happily. “Day after day, questioning, questioning always
and so full of joy. I did not put my hand to the
clay until she was complete in my mind.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” laughed Theria, “so that is the reason you
looked at me so strangely and sometimes did not answer
me. I thought it was because you loved me.”</p>

<p>“And was it not?” Eëtíon retorted, kissing her.</p>

<p>“This statue,” said Nikander, “shall be put at once
into marble. And I require it as your first city-gift to
Delphi.”</p>

<p>Centuries afterward a sculptor of the Island of
Samothrace turned to this pure statue of the earlier
day for the type of his Winged Victory. In his later
hands the draperies were more boisterous in the breeze,
the figure more robust, the skill of handling more complete.
But he never caught the far, sweet dreaminess
of the face which Eëtíon knew.</p>

<p>Nikander’s visit to the colony gave the citizens great
courage and conviction. His praise was ardent, his
criticism unsparing. Thus no doubt many a time had<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
men of the mother city helped and inspired the little
cities beyond the misty deep. Communication between
Delphi and the colonies was astonishingly constant.</p>

<p>As years went by Eëtíon and Theria journeyed back
and forth over the sea carrying the city gifts to Delphi,
bringing back Delphi’s encouragement and advice.</p>

<p>Upon these journeys they took their children, the
glorious children of whom Nikander had prophesied
long before. During the first of these journeys, Theria
longed with almost painful intensity for the arrival in
Delphi. But once there, though she loved her “Place
of Golden Tripods” more deeply than ever, she chafed
at old restrictions, and, the sojourn over, she turned her
face toward her western home feeling that it was home
indeed.</p>

<p>In this western home life was simple but very rich.
From here the young victors went forth to the Pythian
and Olympic games. It was of such western boys
mainly that Pindar sang. Many such a boy was
brought back to the little mountain place by his townsmen
and celebrated almost as a god. Of these, three
in succession were Theria’s own sons. It was
easy to worship such youths not merely for their
strength and outward beauty, but for their nimble wit
and their delicate, fine-trained imagination. They
were gentle seeming but strong as tempered steel.</p>

<p>In this little hill town of Inessa poets and hymn
makers were born, and one of those early scientists
who amaze us by what they fathomed without instruments
or scientific gear. Several young philosophers
who were claimed as being from the more famous towns
and schools were here born and bred.</p>

<p>The city flourished. Its modesty kept it for many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
years from being drawn into the terrible wars which
wrecked Sicily. It tilled the fertile plain below its
Akropolis, and rebuilt the old town on the shore for
a port. But farther than this it did not go. Theria
and her colonists had the Delphic tradition which was
neither conquest nor dominion, but an intensive perfecting
of the life within the town.</p>

<p>And after the passing of the original builders, the
town was, for many generations, the same.</p>

<p>For it is curiously true that a town will retain for
hundreds of years the spirit of its founders. Men may
flock in and overwhelm it in numbers, but the original
subtile spirit, be it good or bad, absorbs the newcomers.
In this lies the immortal glory of the pioneer.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>All is silent now. The hillock lies as ever beholding
the infinite glory of the smoking mountain, the violet
vivid sea, the far-flung island coast where headland after
headland sweeps outward in majestic successive distances,
and between are sheltered bays, sickle-shaped,
untenanted and pure.</p>

<p>Anemones and violets nod in the sea winds growing
in the very cella of the temple. Sheep polish the marble
pillars with their fleeces as they pass, or leave white
woolly wisps upon the brambles in the market place
for birds to gather for their nests.</p>

<p>But who knows whether the godlike young Sicilians
who here still tend their flocks may not show us, shadowed
and dulled with ignorance, some gesture of
Eëtíon’s beauty, some glow of Eleutheria’s grace?</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
